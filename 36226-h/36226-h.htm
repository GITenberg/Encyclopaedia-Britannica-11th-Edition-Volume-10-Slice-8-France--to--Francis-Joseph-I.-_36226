<p class="pt2 center sc">Exterior Policy  1870-1909</p>

<p>The Franco-German War marks a turning-point in the history
of the exterior policy of France as distinct as does the fall of the
ancient monarchy or the end of the Napoleonic epoch.
With the disappearance of the Second Empire, by
<span class="sidenote">The new epoch.</span>
its own fault, on the field of Sedan in September 1870,
followed in the early months of 1871 by the proclamation
of the German empire at Versailles and the annexation of
Alsace and Lorraine under the treaty of peace of Frankfort,
France descended from its primacy among the nations of continental
Europe, which it had gradually acquired in the half-century
subsequent to Waterloo. It was the design of Bismarck
that united Germany, which had been finally established under
his direction by the war of 1870, should take the place hitherto
occupied by France in Europe. The situation of France in 1871
in no wise resembled that after the French defeat of 1815,
when the First Empire, issue of the Revolution, had been upset
by a coalition of the European monarchies which brought back
and supported on his restored throne the legitimate heir to the
French crown. In 1871 the Republic was founded in isolation.
France was without allies, and outside its frontiers the form of
its executive government was a matter of interest only to its
German conquerors. Bismarck desired that France should
remain isolated in Europe and divided at home. He thought
that the Republican form of government would best serve these
ends. The revolutionary tradition of France would, under a
Republic, keep aloof the monarchies of Europe, whereas, in the
words of the German ambassador at Paris, Prince Hohenlohe,
a &ldquo;monarchy would strengthen France and place her in a better
position to make alliances and would threaten our alliances.&rdquo;
At the same time Bismarck counted on governmental instability
under a Republic to bring about domestic disorganization which
would so disintegrate the French nation as to render it unformidable
as a foe and ineffective as an ally. The Franco-German
War thus produced a situation unprecedented in the mutual
relations of two great European powers. From that situation
resulted all the exterior policy of France, for a whole generation,
colonial as well as foreign.</p>

<p>In 1875 Germany saw France in possession of a constitution
which gave promise of durability if not of permanence. German
opinion had already been perturbed by the facility and speed
with which France had paid off the colossal war indemnity
exacted by the conqueror, thus giving proof of the inexhaustible
resources of the country and of its powers of recuperation. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page895" id="page895"></a>895</span>
successful reorganization of the French army under the military
law of 1872 caused further alarm when there appeared to be
some possibility of the withdrawal of Russia from the Dreikaiserbund,
which had set the seal on Germany&rsquo;s triumph and France&rsquo;s
abasement in Europe. It seemed, therefore, as though it
might be expedient for Germany to make a sudden aggression
upon France before that country was adequately prepared for
war, in order to crush the nation irreparably and to remove it
from among the great powers of Europe.</p>

<p>The constitution of the Third Republic was voted by the
National Assembly on the 25th of February 1875. The new
constitution had to be completed by electoral laws and other
complementary provisions, so it could not become effective
until the following year, after the first elections of the newly
founded Senate and Chamber of Deputies. M. Buffet was then
charged by the president of the republic, Marshal MacMahon,
to form a provisional ministry in which the duc Decazes, who
had been foreign minister since 1873, was retained at the Quai
d&rsquo;Orsay. The cabinet met for the first time on the 11th of March,
and ten days later the National Assembly adjourned for a long
recess.</p>

<p>It was during that interval that occurred the incident known
as &ldquo;The Scare of 1875.&rdquo; The Kulturkampf had left Prince
Bismarck in a state of nervous irritation. In all
directions he was on the look out for traces of Ultramontane
<span class="sidenote">The crisis of 1875.</span>
intrigue. The clericals in France after the
fall of Thiers had behaved with great indiscretion in their desire
to see the temporal power of the pope revived. But when the
reactionaries had placed MacMahon at the head of the state,
their divisions and their political ineptitude had shown that
the government of France would soon pass from their hands,
and of this the voting of the Republican constitution by
a monarchical assembly was the visible proof. Nevertheless
Bismarck, influenced by the presence at Berlin of a French
ambassador, M. de Gontaut-Biron, whom he regarded as an
Ultramontane agent, seems to have thought otherwise. A
military party at Berlin affected alarm at a law passed by the
French Assembly on the 12th of March, which continued a
provision increasing from three to four the battalions of each
infantry regiment, and certain journals, supposed to be inspired
by Bismarck, argued that as the French were preparing, it
might be well to anticipate their designs before they were
ready. Europe was scared by an article on the 6th of May in
<i>The Times</i>, professing to reveal the designs of Bismarck, from
its Paris correspondent, Blowitz, who was in relations with
the French foreign minister, the duc Decazes, and with Prince
Hohenlohe, German ambassador to France, both being prudent
diplomatists, and, though Catholics, opposed to Ultramontane
pretensions. Europe was astounded at the revelation and
alarmed at the alleged imminence of war. In England the
Disraeli ministry addressed the governments of Russia, Austria
and Italy, with a view to restraining Germany from its aggressive
designs, and Queen Victoria wrote to the German emperor to
plead the cause of peace. It is probable that there was no need
either for this intervention or for the panic which had produced
it. We know now that the old emperor William was steadfastly
opposed to a fresh war, while his son, the crown prince Frederick,
who then seemed likely soon to succeed him for a long reign,
was also determined that peace should be maintained. The
scare had, however, a most important result, in sowing the seeds
of the subsequent Franco-Russian alliance. Notwithstanding
that the tsar Alexander II. was on terms of affectionate intimacy
with his uncle, the emperor William, he gave a personal assurance
to General Le Flô, French ambassador at St Petersburg, that
France should have the &ldquo;moral support&rdquo; of Russia in the case
of an aggression on the part of Germany. It is possible that the
danger of war was exaggerated by the French foreign minister
and his ambassador at Berlin, as is the opinion of certain French
historians, who think that M. de Gontaut-Biron, as an old
royalist, was only too glad to see the Republic under the protection,
as it were, of the most reactionary monarchy of Europe.
At the same time Bismarck&rsquo;s denials of having acted with
terrorizing intent cannot be accepted. He was more sincere when
he criticized the ostentation with which the Russian Chancellor,
Prince Gortchakoff, had claimed for his master the character
of the defender of France and the obstacle to German
ambitions. It was in memory of this that, in 1878 at the
congress of Berlin, Bismarck did his best to impair the
advantages which Russia had obtained under the treaty of San
Stefano.</p>

<p>The events which led to that congress put into abeyance the
prospect of a serious understanding between France and Russia.
The insurrection in Herzegovina in July 1875 reopened
the Eastern question, and in the Orient the interests
<span class="sidenote">Congress of Berlin.</span>
of France and Russia had been for many years conflicting,
as witness the controversy concerning the Holy
Places, which was one of the causes of the Crimean War. France
had from the reign of Louis XIV. claimed the exclusive right
of protecting Roman Catholic interests in the East. This claim
was supported not only by the monarchists, for the most part
friendly to Russia in other respects, who directed the foreign
policy of the Third Republic until the Russo-Turkish War of
1877, but by the Republicans, who were coming into perpetual
power at the time of the congress of Berlin&mdash;the ablest of the
anti-clericals, Gambetta, declaring in this connexion that
&ldquo;anti-clericalism was not an article of exportation.&rdquo; The
defeat of the monarchists at the elections of 1877, after the
&ldquo;Seize Mai,&rdquo; and the departure from office of the duc Decazes,
whose policy had tended to prepare the way for an alliance with
the tsar, changed the attitude of French diplomacy towards
Russia. M. Waddington, the first Republican minister for foreign
affairs, was not a Russophil, while Gambetta was ardently
anti-Russian, and he, though not a minister, was exercising that
preponderant influence in French politics which he retained
until 1882, the last year of his life. Many Republicans considered
that the monarchists, whom they had turned out, favoured the
support of Russia not only as a defence against Germany, which
was not likely to be effective so long as a friendly uncle and
nephew were reigning at Berlin and at St Petersburg respectively,
but also as a possible means of facilitating a monarchical restoration
in France. Consequently at the congress of Berlin M.
Waddington and the other French delegates maintained a very
independent attitude towards Russia. They supported the
resolutions which aimed at diminishing the advantages obtained
by Russia in the war, they affirmed the rights of France over
the Holy Places, and they opposed the anti-Semitic views of
the Russian representatives. The result of the congress of Berlin
seemed therefore to draw France and Russia farther apart,
especially as Gambetta and the Republicans now in power were
more disposed towards an understanding with England. The
contrary, however, happened. The treaty of Berlin, which took
the place of the treaty of San Stefano, was the ruin of Russian
hopes. It was attributed to the support given by Bismarck
to the anti-Russian policy of England and Austria at the
congress, the German chancellor having previously discouraged
the project of an alliance between Russia and Germany. The
consequence was that the tsar withdrew from the Dreikaiserbund,
and Germany, finding the support of Austria inadequate for its
purposes, sought an understanding with Italy. Hence arose
the Triple Alliance of 1882, which was the work of Bismarck,
who thus became eventually the author of the Franco-Russian
alliance, which was rather a sedative for the nervous temperament
of the French than a remedy necessary for their protection.
The twofold aim of the Triplice was the development of the
Bismarckian policy of the continued isolation of France and of
the maintenance of the situation in Europe acquired by the
German empire in 1871. The most obvious alliance for Germany
was that with Russia, but it was clear that it could be obtained
only at the price of Russia having a free hand to satisfy its
ambitions in the East. This not only would have irritated
England against Germany, but also Austria, and so might have
brought about a Franco-Austrian alliance, and a day of reckoning
for Germany for the combined rancours of two nations, left
by 1866 and 1871. It was thus that Germany allied itself first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page896" id="page896"></a>896</span>
with Austria and then with Italy, leaving Russia eventually
to unite with France.</p>

<p>As the congress of Berlin took in review the general situation
of the Turkish empire, it was natural that the French delegates
should formulate the position of France in Egypt.
Thus the powers of Europe accepted the maintenance
<span class="sidenote">Egyptian question.</span>
of the <i>condominium</i> in Egypt, financial and administrative,
of England and France. Egypt, nominally a province of
the Turkish empire, had been invested with a large degree of
autonomy, guaranteed by an agreement made in 1840 and 1841
between the Porte and the then five great powers, though some
opposition was made to France being a party to this compact.
By degrees Austria, Prussia and Russia (as well as Italy when it
attained the rank of a great power) had left the international
control of Egypt to France and England by reason of the preponderance
of the interests of those two powers on the Nile.</p>

<p>In 1875 the interests of England in Egypt, which had hitherto
been considered inferior to those of France, gained a superiority
owing to the purchase by the British government of the shares
of the khedive Ismail in the Suez Canal. Whatever rivalry there
may have been between England and France, they had to present
a united front to the pretensions of Ismail, whose prodigalities
made him impatient of the control which they exercised over his
finances. This led to his deposition and exile. The control was
re-established by his successor Tewfik on the 4th of September
1879. The revival ensued of a so-called national party, which
Ismail for his own purposes had encouraged in its movement
hostile to foreign domination. In September 1881 took place
the rising led by Arabi, by whose action an assembly of notables
was convoked for the purpose of deposing the government
authorized by the European powers. The fear lest the sultan
should intervene gave an appearance of harmony to the policy
of England and France, whose interests were too great to permit
of any such interference. At the end of 1879 the first Freycinet
cabinet had succeeded that of M. Waddington and had in turn
been succeeded in September 1880 by the first Ferry cabinet.
In the latter the foreign minister was M. Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire,
an aged philosopher who had first taken part in politics
when he helped to dethrone Charles X. in 1830. In September
1881 he categorically invited the British government to join
France in a military intervention to oppose any interference
which the Porte might attempt, and the two powers each sent
a war-ship to Alexandria. On the 14th of November Gambetta
formed his <i>grand ministère</i>, in which he was foreign minister.
Though it lasted less than eleven weeks, important measures
were taken by it, as Arabi had become under-secretary for war at
Cairo, and was receiving secret encouragement from the sultan.
On the 7th of January 1882, at the instance of Gambetta, a
joint note was presented by the British and French consuls to
the khedive, to the effect that their governments were resolved
to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, Gambetta having designed this as a
consecration of the Anglo-French alliance in the East. Thereupon
the Porte protested, by a circular addressed to the powers,
against this infringement of its suzerainty in Egypt. Meanwhile,
the assembly of notables claimed the right of voting the taxes
and administering the finances of the country, and Gambetta,
considering this as an attempt to emancipate Egypt from the
financial control of Europe, moved the British government to
join with France in protesting against any interference on the
part of the notables in the budget. But when Lord Granville
accepted this proposal Gambetta had fallen, on the 26th of
January, being succeeded by M. de Freycinet, who for the second
time became president of the council and foreign minister.
Gambetta fell nominally on a scheme of partial revision of the
constitution. It included the re-establishment of <i>scrutin de liste</i>,
a method of voting to which many Republicans were hostile, so
this gave his enemies in his own party their opportunity. He
thus fell the victim of republican jealousy, nearly half the Republicans
in the chamber voting against him in the fatal division.
The subsequent debates of 1882 show that many of Gambetta&rsquo;s
adversaries were also opposed to his policy of uniting with
England on the Egyptian question. Henceforth the interior
affairs of Egypt have little to do with the subject we are treating;
but some of the incidents in France which led to the English
occupation of Egypt ought to be mentioned. M. de Freycinet
was opposed to any armed intervention by France; but in the
face of the feeling in the country in favour of maintaining the
traditional influence of France in Egypt, his declarations of
policy were vague. On the 23rd of February 1882 he said that
he would assure the non-exclusive preponderance in Egypt of
France and England by means of an understanding with Europe,
and on the 11th of May that he wished to retain for France its
peculiar position of privileged influence. England and France
sent to Alexandria a combined squadron, which did not prevent
a massacre of Europeans there on the 11th of June, the khedive
being now in the hands of the military party under Arabi. On
the 11th of July the English fleet bombarded Alexandria, the
French ships in anticipation of that action having departed the
previous day. On the 18th of July the Chamber debated the
supplementary vote for the fleet in the Mediterranean, M. de
Freycinet declaring that France would take no active part in
Egypt except as the mandatory of the European powers. This
was the occasion for the last great speech of Gambetta in parliament.
In it he earnestly urged close co-operation with England,
which he predicted would otherwise become the mistress of
Egypt, and in his concluding sentences he uttered the famous
&ldquo;<i>Ne rompez jamais l&rsquo;alliance anglaise.</i>&rdquo; A further vote, proposed
in consequence of Arabi&rsquo;s open rebellion, was abandoned,
as M. de Freycinet announced that the European powers declined
to give France and England a collective mandate to intervene
in their name. In the Senate on the 25th of July M. Scherer,
better known as a philosopher than as a politician, who had
Gambetta&rsquo;s confidence, read a report on the supplementary votes
which severely criticized the timidity and vacillation of the
government in Egyptian policy. Four days later in the Chamber
M. de Freycinet proposed an understanding with England limited
to the protection of the Suez Canal. Attacked by M. Clémenceau
on the impossibility of separating the question of the canal
from the general Egyptian question, the ministry was defeated
by a huge majority, and M. de Freycinet fell, having achieved
the distinction of being the chief instrument in removing Egypt
from the sphere of French interest.</p>

<p>Some of the Republicans whose votes turned out M. de Freycinet
wanted Jules Ferry to take his place, as he was considered
to be a strong man in foreign policy, and Gambetta, for this
reason, was willing to see his personal enemy at the head of public
affairs. But this was prevented by M. Clémenceau and the
extreme Left, and the new ministry was formed by M. Duclerc,
an old senator whose previous official experience had been under
the Second Republic. On its taking office on the 7th of August,
the ministerial declaration announced that its policy would be in
conformity with the vote which, by refusing supplies for the
occupation of the Suez Canal, had overthrown M. de Freycinet.
The declaration characterized this vote as &ldquo;a measure of reserve
and of prudence but not as an abdication.&rdquo; Nevertheless the
action of the Chamber&mdash;which was due to the hostility to
Gambetta of rival leaders, who had little mutual affection,
including MM. de Freycinet, Jules Ferry, Clémenceau and the
president of the Republic, M. Grévy, rather than to a desire to
abandon Egypt&mdash;did result in the abdication of France. After
England single-handed had subdued the rebellion and restored
the authority of the khedive, the latter signed a decree on the
11th of January 1883 abolishing the joint control of England
and France. Henceforth Egypt continued to be a frequent topic
of debate in the Chambers; the interests of France in respect
of the Egyptian finances, the judicial system and other institutions
formed the subject of diplomatic correspondence, as did
the irritating question of the eventual evacuation of Egypt by
England. But though it caused constant friction between the
two countries up to the Anglo-French convention of the 8th of
April 1904, there was no longer a French active policy with regard
to Egypt. The lost predominance of France in that country
did, however, quicken French activity in other regions of northern
Africa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page897" id="page897"></a>897</span></p>

<p>The idea that the Mediterranean might become a French lake
has, in different senses, been a preoccupation for France and for
its rivals in Europe ever since Algeria became a French
province by a series of fortuitous incidents&mdash;an insult
<span class="sidenote">Algerian policy.</span>
offered by the dey to a French consul, his refusal to
make reparation, and the occasion it afforded of diverting public
attention in France from interior affairs after the Revolution
of 1830. The French policy of preponderance in Egypt had only
for a secondary aim the domination of the Mediterranean.
The French tradition in Egypt was a relic of Napoleon&rsquo;s vain
scheme to become emperor of the Orient even before he had made
himself emperor of the West. It was because Egypt was the
highway to India that under Napoleon III. the French had constructed
the Suez Canal, and for the same reason England could
never permit them to become masters of the Nile delta. But
the possessors of Algeria could extend their coast-line of North
Africa without seriously menacing the power which held Gibraltar
and Malta. It was Italy which objected to a French occupation
of Tunis. Algeria has never been officially a French &ldquo;colony.&rdquo;
It is in many respects administered as an integral portion of
French territory, the governor-general, as agent of the central
power, exercising wide jurisdiction. Although the Europeans
in Algeria are less than a seventh of the population, and
although the French are actually a minority of the European
inhabitants&mdash;Spaniards prevailing in the west, Italians and
Maltese in the east&mdash;the three departments of Constantine,
Algiers and Oran are administered like three French departments.
Consequently, when disturbances occurred on the borderland
separating Constantine from Tunis, the French were able to say
to Europe that the integrity of their national frontier was threatened
by the proximity of a turbulent neighbour. The history of
the relations between Tunis and France were set forth, from the
French standpoint, in a circular, of which Jules Ferry was said
to be the author, addressed by the foreign minister, M. Barthélemy
Saint-Hilaire on the 9th of May 1881, to the diplomatic agents
of France abroad. The most important point emphasized by
<span class="sidenote">Tunis.</span>
the French minister was the independence of Tunis
from the Porte, a situation which would obviate difficulties
with Turkey such as had always hampered the European
powers in Egypt. In support of this contention a protest made
by the British government in 1830, against the French conquest
of Algiers, was quoted, as in it Lord Aberdeen had declared that
Europe had always treated the Barbary states as independent
powers. On the other hand, there was the incident of the bey
of Tunis having furnished to Turkey a contingent during the
Crimean War, which suggested a recognition of its vassalage
to the Sublime Porte. But in 1864, when the sultan had sent a
fleet to La Goulette to affirm his &ldquo;rights&rdquo; in Tunis, the French
ambassador at Constantinople intimated that France declined
to have Turkey for a neighbour in Algeria. France also in 1868
essayed to obtain control over the finances of the regency; but
England and Italy had also large interests in the country, so an
international financial commission was appointed. In 1871,
when France was disabled after the war, the bey obtained from
Constantinople a firman of investiture, thus recognizing the
suzerainty of the Porte. Certain English writers have reproached
the Foreign Office for its lack of foresight in not taking advantage
of France&rsquo;s disablement by establishing England as the preponderant
power in Tunis. The fact that five-sixths of the commerce
of Tunis is now with France and Algeria may seem to
justify such regrets. Yet by the light of subsequent events it
seems probable that England would have been diverted from
more profitable undertakings had she been saddled with the
virtual administration and military occupation of a vast territory
which such preponderance would have entailed. The wonder is
that this opportunity was not seized by Italy; for Mazzini and
other workers in the cause of Italian unity, before the Bourbons
had been driven from Naples, had cast eyes on Tunis, lying over
against the coasts of Sicily at a distance of barely 100 m., as a
favourable field for colonization and as the key of the African
Mediterranean. But when Rome became once more the capital
of Italy, Carthage was not fated to fall again under its domination
and the occasion offered by France&rsquo;s temporary impotence was
neglected. In 1875 when France was rapidly recovering, there
went to Tunis as consul an able Frenchman, M. Roustan, who
became virtual ruler of the regency in spite of the resistance of
the representative of Italy. French action was facilitated by
the attitude of England. On the 26th of July 1878 M. Waddington
wrote to the marquis d&rsquo;Harcourt, French ambassador in
London, that at the congress of Berlin Lord Salisbury had said to
him&mdash;the two delegates being the foreign ministers of their
respective governments&mdash;in reply to his protest, on behalf of
France, against the proposed English occupation of Cyprus,
&ldquo;Do what you think proper in Tunis: England will offer no
opposition.&rdquo; This was confirmed by Lord Salisbury in a despatch
to Lord Lyons, British ambassador in Paris, on the 8th of August,
and it was followed in October by an intimation made by the
French ambassador at Rome that France intended to exercise
a preponderant influence in Tunis. Italy was not willing to
accept this situation. In January 1881 a tour made by King
Humbert in Sicily, where he received a Tunisian mission, was
taken to signify that Italy had not done with Tunis, and it was
answered in April by a French expedition in the regency sent from
Algeria, on the pretext of punishing the Kroumirs who had been
marauding on the frontier of Constantine. It was on this occasion
that M. Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire issued the circular quoted
above. France nominally was never at war with Tunis; yet the
result of the invasion was that that country became virtually a
French possession, although officially it is only under the protection
of France. The treaty of El Bardo of the 12th of May
1881, confirmed by the decree of the 22nd of April 1882, placed
Tunis under the protectorate of France. The country is
administered under the direction of the French Foreign Office,
in which there is a department of Tunisian affairs. The governor
is called minister resident-general of France, and he also acts
as foreign minister, being assisted by seven French and two
native ministers.</p>

<p>The annexation of Tunis was important for many reasons.
It was the first successful achievement of France after the
disasters of the Franco-German War, and it was the
first enterprise of serious utility to France undertaken
<span class="sidenote">Extension of African Territory.</span>
beyond its frontiers since the early period of the Second
Empire. It was also important as establishing the
hegemony of France on the southern shores of the Mediterranean.
When M. Jules Cambon became governor-general of Algeria, his
brother M. Paul Cambon having been previously French resident
in Tunis and remaining the vigilant ambassador to a Mediterranean
power, a Parisian wit said that just as Switzerland had its
<i>Lac des quatre</i> Cantons, so France had made of the midland sea
its <i>Lac des deux Cambons</i>. The <i>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i> indicated what was
the primary significance to the French of their becoming masters
of the Barbary coast from the boundary of Morocco to that of
Tripoli. Apart from the Mediterranean question, when the
scramble for Africa began and the Hinterland doctrine was
asserted by European powers, the possession of this extended
coast-line resulted in France laying claim to the Sahara and the
western Sudan. Consequently, on the maps, the whole of northwest
Africa, from Tunis to the Congo, is claimed by France with
the exception of the relatively small areas on the coast belonging
to Morocco, Spain, Portugal, Liberia, Germany and England.
On this basis, in point of area, France is the greatest African
power, in spite of British annexations in south and equatorial
Africa, its area being estimated at 3,866,950 sq. m. (including
227,950 in Madagascar) as against 2,101,411 more effectively
possessed by Great Britain. The immensity of its domain on
paper is no doubt a satisfaction to a people which prefers to
pursue its policy of colonial expansion without the aid of emigration.
The acquisition of Tunis by France is also important as
an example of the system of protectorate as applied to colonization.
Open annexation might have more gravely irritated the
powers having interests in the country. England, in spite of
Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s suggestions to the French foreign minister,
was none too pleased with France&rsquo;s policy; while Italy, with
its subjects outnumbering all other European settlers in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page898" id="page898"></a>898</span>
regency, was in a mood to accept a pretext for a quarrel for the
reasons already mentioned. Apart from these considerations
<span class="sidenote">The protectorate system.</span>
the French government favoured a protectorate
because it did not wish to make of Tunis a second
Algeria. While the annexation of the latter had
excellent commercial results for France, it had not
been followed by successful colonization, though it had cost
France 160 millions sterling in the first sixty years after it
became French territory. The French cannot govern at home
or abroad without a centralized system of administration.
The organization of Algeria, as departments of France with their
administrative divisions, was not an example to imitate. In the
beylical government France found, ready-made, a sufficiently
centralized system, such as did not exist in Algeria under native
rule, which could form a basis of administration by French
functionaries under the direction of the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay. The
result has not been unpleasing to the numerous advocates in
France of protectorates as a means of colonization. According
to M. Paul Leroy-Beaulieu, the most eminent French authority
on colonization, who knows Tunis well, a protectorate is the
most pacific, the most supple, and the least costly method of
colonization in countries where an organized form of native
government exists; it is the system in which the French can most
nearly approach that of English crown colonies. One evil which
it avoids is the so-called representative system, under which
senators and deputies are sent to the French parliament not only
from Algeria as an integral part of France, but from the colonies
of Martinique, Guadeloupe and French India, while Cochin-China,
Guiana and Senegal send deputies alone. These sixteen
deputies and seven senators attach themselves to the various
Moderate, Radical and Socialist groups in parliament, which
have no connexion with the interests of the colonies; and the
consequent introduction of French political controversies into
colonial elections has not been of advantage to the oversea
possessions of France. From this the protectorate system has
spared Tunis, and the paucity of French immigration will continue
to safeguard that country from parliamentary representation.
After twenty years of French rule, of 120,000 European
residents in Tunis, not counting the army, only 22,000 were
French, while nearly 70,000 were Italian. If under a so-called
representative system the Italians had demanded nationalization,
for the purpose of obtaining the franchise, complications might
have arisen which are not to be feared under a protectorate.</p>

<p>But of all the results of the French annexation of Tunis, the
most important was undoubtedly the Triple Alliance, into
which Italy entered in resentment at having been
deprived of the African territory which seemed marked
<span class="sidenote">The Triple Alliance.</span>
out as its natural field for colonial expansion. The
most manifest cause of Italian hostility towards France
had passed away four years before the annexation of Tunis,
when the reactionaries, who had favoured the restitution of the
temporal power of the pope, fell for ever from power. The
clericalism of the anti-republicans, who favoured a revival
of the fatal policy of the Second Empire whereby France, after
Magenta and Solferino, had by leaving its garrison at St Angelo,
been the last obstacle to Italian unity, was one of the chief
causes of their downfall. For after the war with Germany, the
mutilated land and the vanquished nation had need to avoid
wanton provocations of foreign powers. Henceforth the French
Republic, governed by Republicans, was to be an anti-clerical
force in Europe, sympathizing with the Italian occupation of
Rome. But to make Italy realize that France was no longer
the enemy of complete Italian unity it would have been necessary
that all causes of irritation between the two Latin sister nations
were removed. Such causes of dissension did, however, remain,
arising from economic questions. The maritime relations of
the two chief Mediterranean powers were based on a treaty
of navigation of 1862&mdash;when Venice was no party to it being
an Austrian port&mdash;which Crispi denounced as a relic of Italian
servility towards Napoleon III. Commercial rivalry was
induced by the industrial development of northern Italy, when
freed from Austrian rule. Moreover, the emigrant propensity
of the Italians flooded certain regions of France with Italian
cheap labour, with the natural result of bitter animosity between
the intruders and the inhabitants of the districts thus invaded.
The annexation of Tunis, coming on the top of these causes
of irritation, exasperated Italy. A new treaty of commerce
was nevertheless signed between the two countries on the 3rd
of November 1881. Unfortunately for its stability, King
Humbert the previous week had gone to Vienna to see the
emperor of Austria. In visiting in his capital the former arch-enemy
of Italian unity, who could never return the courtesy,
Rome being interdicted for Catholic sovereigns by the &ldquo;prisoner
of the Vatican,&rdquo; Humbert had only followed the example of his
father Victor Emmanuel, who went both to Berlin and to Vienna
in 1873. But that was when in France the duc de Broglie was
prime minister of a clerical government of which many of the
supporters were clamouring for the restitution of the temporal
power. King Humbert&rsquo;s visit to Vienna at the moment when
Gambetta, the great anti-clerical champion, was at the height
of his influence was significant for other reasons. Since the
7th of October 1879 Germany and Austria had been united by a
defensive treaty, and though its provisions were not published
until 1888, the two central empires were known to be in the
closest alliance. The king of Italy&rsquo;s visit to Vienna, where he
was accompanied by his ministers Depretis and Mancini, had
therefore the same significance as though he had gone to Berlin
also. On the 20th of May 1882 was signed the treaty of the
Triple Alliance, which for many years bound Italy to Germany
in its relations with the continental powers. The alliance was
first publicly announced on the 13th of March 1883, in the
Italian Chamber, by Signor Mancini, minister for foreign affairs.
The aim of Italy in joining the combination was alliance with
Germany, the enemy of France. The connexion with Austria
was only tolerated because it secured a union with the powerful
government of Berlin. It effected the complete isolation of
France in Europe. An understanding between the French
Republic and Russia, which alone could alter that situation, was
impracticable, as its only basis seemed to be the possibility of
having a common enemy in Germany or even in England. But
that double eventuality was anticipated by a secret convention
concluded at Skiernewice in September 1884 by the tsar and
the German emperor, in which they guaranteed to one another
a benevolent neutrality in case of hostilities between England
and Russia arising out of the Afghan question.</p>

<p>It will be convenient here to refer to the relations of France
with Germany and Italy respectively in the years succeeding
the signature of the Triple Alliance. With Germany both
Gambetta, who died ten weeks before the treaty was announced
and who was a strong Russophobe, and his adversary Jules Ferry
were inclined to come to an understanding. But in this they
had not the support of French opinion. In September 1883
the king of Spain had visited the sovereigns of Austria and
Germany. Alphonso XII., to prove that this journey was not
a sign of hostility to France, came to Paris on his way home
on Michaelmas Day on an official visit to President Grévy.
Unfortunately it was announced that the German emperor had
made the king colonel of a regiment of Uhlans garrisoned at
Strassburg, the anniversary of the taking of which city was being
celebrated by the emperor by the inauguration of a monument
made out of cannon taken from the French, on the very eve of
King Alphonso&rsquo;s arrival. Violent protests were made in Paris
in the monarchical and in not a few republican journals,
with the result that the king of Spain was hooted by the crowd
as he drove with the president from the station to his embassy,
and again on his way to dine the same night at the Elysée. The
incident was closed by M. Grévy&rsquo;s apologies and by the retirement
of the minister of war, General Thibaudin, who under pressure
from the extreme Left had declined to meet <i>le roi uhlan</i>. Though
it displayed the bitter hostility of the population towards
Germany, the incident did not aggravate Franco-German
relations. This was due to the policy of the prime minister,
Jules Ferry, who to carry it out made himself foreign minister
in November, in the place of Challemel-Lacour, who resigned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page899" id="page899"></a>899</span></p>

<p>Jules Ferry&rsquo;s idea was that colonial expansion was the surest
means for France to recover its prestige, and that this could
be obtained only by maintaining peaceful relations
with all the powers of Europe. His consequent
<span class="sidenote">Franco-German relations.</span>
unpopularity caused his fall in April 1885, and the next
year a violent change of military policy was marked
by the arrival of General Boulanger at the ministry of
war, where he remained, in the Freycinet and Goblet cabinets,
from January 1886 to the 17th of May 1887. His growing popularity
in France was answered by Bismarck, who asked for
an increased vote for the German army, indicating that he
considered Boulanger the coming dictator for the war of revenge;
so when the Reichstag, on the 14th of January 1887, voted the
supplies for three years, instead of for the seven demanded by the
chancellor, it was dissolved. Bismarck redoubled his efforts in the
press and in diplomacy, vainly attempting to come to an understanding
with Russia and with more success moving the Vatican
to order the German Catholics to support him. He obtained
his vote for seven years in March, and the same month renewed
the Triple Alliance. In April the Schnaebelé incident seemed
nearly to cause war between France and Germany. The commissary-special,
an agent of the ministry of the interior, at
Pagny-sur-Moselle, the last French station on the frontier of the
annexed territory of Lorraine, having stepped across the boundary
to regulate some official matter with the corresponding functionary
on the German side, was arrested. It was said that
Schnaebelé was arrested actually on French soil, and on whichever
side of the line he was standing he had gone to meet the German
official at the request of the latter. Bismarck justified the
outrage in a speech in the Prussian Landtag which suggested
that it was impossible to live at peace with a nation so bellicose
as the French. In France the incident was regarded as a trap
laid by the chancellor to excite French opinion under the aggressive
guidance of Boulanger, and to produce events which would
precipitate a war. The French remained calm, in spite of the
growing popularity of Boulanger. The Goblet ministry resigned
on the 17th of May 1887 after a hostile division on the budget,
and the opportunity was taken to get rid of the minister of war,
who posed as the coming restorer of Alsace and Lorraine to France.
The Boulangist movement soon became anti-Republican, and
the opposition to it of successive ministries improved the official
relations of the French and German governments. The circumstances
attending the fall of President Grévy the same year
strengthened the Boulangist agitation, and Jules Ferry, who
seemed indicated as his successor, was discarded by the Republican
majority in the electoral congress, as a revolution was
threatened in Paris if the choice fell on &ldquo;the German Ferry.&rdquo;
Sadi Carnot was consequently elected president of the Republic
on the 3rd of December 1887. Three months later, on the 9th
of March 1888, died the old emperor William who had personified
the conquest of France by Germany. His son, the pacific emperor
Frederick, died too, on the 15th of June, so the accession of
William II., the pupil of Bismarck, at a moment when Boulanger
threatened to become plebiscitary dictator of France, was
ominous for the peace of Europe. But in April 1889 Boulanger
ignominiously fled the country, and in March 1890 Bismarck
fell. France none the less rejected all friendly overtures made
by the young emperor. In February 1891 his mother came to
Paris and was unluckily induced to visit the scenes of German
triumph near the capital&mdash;the ruins of St Cloud and the Château
of Versailles where the German empire was proclaimed. The
incident called forth such an explosion of wrath from the French
press that it was clear that France had not forgotten 1871.
By this time, however, France was no longer isolated and at
the mercy of Germany, which by reason of the increase of its
population while that of France had remained almost stationary,
was, under the system of compulsory military service in the
two countries, more than a match for its neighbour in a single-handed
conflict. Even the Triple Alliance ceased to be a terror
for France. An understanding arose between France and
Russia preliminary to the Franco-Russian alliance, which became
the pivot of French exterior relations until the defeat of Russia
in the Japanese war of 1904. So the second renewal of the
Triplice was forthwith answered by a visit of the French squadron
to Kronstadt in July 1891.</p>

<p>While such were the relations between France and the principal
party to the Triple Alliance, the same period was marked by
bitter dissension between France and Italy. Tunis
had made Italy Gallophobe, but the diplomatic
<span class="sidenote">France and Italy.</span>
relations between the two countries had been courteous
until the death of Depretis in 1887. When Crispi
succeeded him as prime minister, and till 1891 was the director
of the exterior policy of Italy, a change took place. Crispi,
though not the author of the Triple Alliance, entered with
enthusiasm into its spirit of hostility to France. The old Sicilian
revolutionary hastened to pay his respects to Bismarck at Friedrichsruh
in October 1887, the visit being highly approved in
Italy. Before that the French Chamber had, in July 1886, by a
small majority, rejected a new treaty of navigation between
France and Italy, this being followed by the failure to renew
the commercial treaty of 1881. Irritating incidents were of
constant occurrence. In 1888 a conflict between the French
consul at Massowah and the Italians who occupied that Abyssinian
port induced Bismarck to instruct the German ambassador in
Paris to tell M. Goblet, minister for foreign affairs in the Floquet
cabinet, in case he should refer to the matter, that if Italy were
involved thereby in complications it would not stand alone&mdash;this
menace being communicated to Crispi by the Italian
ambassador at Berlin and officially printed in a green-book.
But after Bismarck&rsquo;s fall relations improved a little, and in April
1890 the Italian fleet was sent to Toulon to salute President
Carnot in the name of King Humbert, though this did not
prevent the French government being suspected of having
designs on Tripoli. Italian opinion was again incensed against
France by the action of the French clericals, represented by a
band of Catholic &ldquo;pilgrims&rdquo; who went to Rome to offer their
sympathy to the pope in the autumn of 1891, and outraged the
burial-place of Victor Emmanuel by writing in the visitors&rsquo; register
kept at the Pantheon the words &ldquo;<i>Vive le pape.</i>&rdquo; In August
1893 a fight took place at Aigues Mortes, the medieval walled
city on the salt marshes of the Gulf of Lyons, between French
and Italian workmen, in which seven Italians were killed. But
Crispi had gone out of office early in 1891, and the ministers
who succeeded him were more disposed to prevent a rupture
between Italy and France. Crispi became prime minister again
in December 1893, but this time without the portfolio of foreign
affairs. He placed at the Consulta Baron Blanc, who though a
strong partisan of the Triple Alliance was closely attached to
France, being a native of Savoy, where he spent his yearly
vacations on French soil. That the relations between the two
nations were better was shown by what occurred after the
murder of President Carnot in June 1894. The fact that the
assassin was an Italian might have caused trouble a little earlier;
but the grief of the Italians was so sincere, as shown by popular
demonstrations at Rome, that no anti-Italian violence took
place in France, and in the words of the French ambassador,
M. Billot, Caserio&rsquo;s crime seemed likely to further an understanding
between the two peoples. The movement was very
slight and made no progress during the short presidency of M.
Casimir-Périer. On the 1st of November 1894 Alexander III.
died, when the Italian press gave proof of the importance attributed
by the Triplice to the Franco-Russian understanding
by expressing a hope that the new tsar would put an end to it.
But on the 10th of June 1895, the foreign minister, M. Hanotaux,
intimated to the French Chamber that the understanding had
become an alliance, and on the 17th the Russian ambassador
in Paris conveyed to M. Félix Faure, who was now president
of the Republic, the collar of St Andrew, while the same day
the French and Russian men-of-war, invited to the opening of
the Kiel Canal, entered German waters together. The union of
France with Russia was no doubt one cause of the cessation of
Italian hostility to France; but others were at work. The inauguration
of the statue of MacMahon at Magenta the same week
as the announcement of the Franco-Russian alliance showed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page900" id="page900"></a>900</span>
there was a disposition to revive the old sentiment of fraternity
which had once united France with Italy. More important was
the necessity felt by the Italians of improved commercial relations
with the French. Crispi fell on the 4th of March 1896,
after the news of the disaster to the Italian troops at Adowa,
the war with Abyssinia being a disastrous legacy left by him.
The previous year he had caused the withdrawal from Paris of
the Italian ambassador Signor Ressmann, a friend of France,
transferring thither Count Tornielli, who during his mission
in London had made a speech, after the visit of the Italian fleet
to Toulon, which qualified him to rank as a <i>misogallo</i>. But with
the final disappearance of Crispi the relations of the two Latin
neighbours became more natural. Commerce between them had
diminished, and the business men of both countries, excepting
certain protectionists, felt that the commercial rupture was
mutually prejudicial. Friendly negotiations were initiated on
both sides, and almost the last act of President Félix Faure
before his sudden death&mdash;M. Delcassé being then foreign minister&mdash;was
to promulgate, on the 2nd of February 1899, a new commercial
arrangement between France and Italy which the
French parliament had adopted. By that time M. Barrère was
ambassador at the Quirinal and was engaged in promoting
cordial relations between Italy and France, of which Count
Tornielli in Paris had already become an ardent advocate.
Italy remained a party to the Triple Alliance, which was renewed
for a third period in 1902. But so changed had its significance
become that in October 1903 the French Republic received for
the first time an official visit from the sovereigns of Italy.
This reconciliation of France and Italy was destined to have most
important results outside the sphere of the Triple Alliance.
The return visit which President Loubet paid to Victor Emmanuel
III. in April 1904, it being the first time that a French chief of the
state had gone to Rome since the pope had lost the temporal
sovereignty, provoked a protest from the Vatican which caused
the rupture of diplomatic relations between France and the Holy
See, followed by the repudiation of the Concordat by an act
passed in France, in 1905, separating the church from the state.</p>

<p>While the decadence of the Triple Alliance had this important
effect on the domestic affairs of France, its inception had produced
the Franco-Russian alliance, which took France
out of its isolation in Europe, and became the pivot
<span class="sidenote">Russian alliance.</span>
of its exterior policy. It has been noted that in the
years succeeding the Franco-Prussian War the tsar Alexander II.
had shown a disposition to support France against German
aggression, as though to make up for his neutrality during the
war, which was so benevolent for Germany that his uncle
William I. had ascribed to it a large share of the German victory.
The assassination of Alexander II. by revolutionaries in 1881
made it difficult for the new autocrat to cultivate closer relations
with a Republican government, although the Third Republic,
under the influence of Gambetta, to whom its consolidation was
chiefly due, had repudiated that proselytizing spirit, inherited
from the great Revolution, which had disquieted the monarchies
of Europe in 1848 and had provoked their hostility to the Second
Republic. But the Triple Alliance which was concluded the
year after the murder of the tsar indicated the possible expediency
of an understanding between the two great powers of the West
and the East, in response to the combination of the three central
powers of Europe,&mdash;though Bismarck after his fall revealed that
in 1884 a secret treaty was concluded between Germany and
Russia, which was, however, said to have in view a war between
England and Russia. Internal dissension on the subject of
colonial policy in the far East, followed by the fall of Jules
Ferry and the Boulangist agitation were some of the causes
which prevented France from strengthening its position in
Europe by seeking a formal understanding with Russia in the
first part of the reign of Alexander III. But when the Boulangist
movement came to an end, entirely from the incompetency of
its leader, it behoved the government of the Republic to find a
means of satisfying the strong patriotic sentiment revealed in
the nation, which, directed by a capable and daring soldier,
would have swept away the parliamentary republic and established
a military dictatorship in its place. The Franco-Russian
understanding provided that means, and Russia was ready for
it, having become, by the termination in 1890 of the secret
treaty with Germany, not less isolated in Europe than France.
In July 1891, when the French fleet visited Kronstadt the
incident caused such enthusiasm throughout the French nation
that the exiled General Boulanger&rsquo;s existence would have been
forgotten, except among his dwindling personal followers, had
he not put an end to it by suicide two months later at Brussels.
The Franco-Russian understanding united all parties, not in
love for one another but in the idea that France was thereby
about to resume its place in Europe. The Catholic Royalists
ceased to talk of the restitution of the temporal power of the
pope in their joy at the deference of the government of the
republic for the most autocratic monarchy of Christendom;
the Boulangists, now called Nationalists, hoped that it would
lead to the war of revenge with Germany, and that it might also
be the means of humiliating England, as shown by their resentment
at the visit of the French squadron to Portsmouth on its
way home from Kronstadt. It is, however, extremely improbable
that the understanding and subsequent alliance would have been
effected had the Boulangist movement succeeded. For the last
thing that the Russian government desired was war with Germany.
What it needed and obtained was security against
German aggression on its frontier and financial aid from France;
so a French plebiscitary government, having for its aim the
restitution of Alsace and Lorraine, would have found no support
in Russia. As the German chancellor, Count von Caprivi, said
in the Reichstag on the 27th of November 1891, a few weeks
after a Russian loan had been subscribed in France nearly
eight times over, the naval visit to Kronstadt had not brought
war nearer by one single inch. Nevertheless when in 1893 the
Russian fleet paid a somewhat tardy return visit to Toulon,
where it was reviewed by President Carnot, a party of Russian
officers who came to Paris was received by the population of
the capital, which less than five years before had acclaimed
General Boulanger, with raptures which could not have been
exceeded had they brought back to France the territory lost in
1871. In November 1894, Alexander III. died, and in January
1895, M. Casimir-Périer resigned the presidency of the Republic,
to which he had succeeded only six months before on the assassination
of M. Carnot. So it was left to Nicholas II. and President
Félix Faure to proclaim the existence of a formal alliance between
France and Russia. It appears that in 1891 and 1892, at the
time of the first public manifestations of friendship between
France and Russia, in the words of M. Ribot, secret conventions
were signed by him, being foreign minister, and M. de Freycinet,
president of the council, which secured for France &ldquo;the support
of Russia for the maintenance of the equilibrium in Europe&rdquo;;
and on a later occasion the same statesman said that it was after
the visit of the empress Frederick to Paris in 1891 that Alexander
III. made to France certain offers which were accepted. The
word &ldquo;alliance&rdquo; was not publicly used by any minister to
connote the relations of France with Russia until the 10th of June
1895, when M. Hanotaux used the term with cautious vagueness
amid the applause of the Chamber of Deputies. Yet not even
when Nicholas II. came to France in October 1896 was the word
&ldquo;alliance&rdquo; formally pronounced in any of the official speeches.
But the reception given to the tsar and tsaritsa in Paris, where
no European sovereign had come officially since William of
Germany passed down the Champs Elysées as a conqueror,
was of such a character that none could doubt that this was the
consecration of the alliance. It was at last formally proclaimed
by Nicholas II., on board a French man-of-war, on the occasion
of the visit of the president of the Republic to Russia in August
1897. From that date until the formation of M. Briand&rsquo;s
cabinet in 1909, nine different ministries succeeded one another
and five ministers of foreign affairs; but they all loyally supported
the Franco-Russian alliance, although its popularity
diminished in France long before the war between Russia and
Japan, which deprived it of its efficacy in Europe. In 1901
Nicholas II. came again to France and was the guest of President
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page901" id="page901"></a>901</span>
Loubet at Compiègne. His visit excited little enthusiasm
in the nation, which was disposed to attribute it to Russia&rsquo;s
financial need of France; while the Socialists, now a strong
party which provided the Waldeck-Rousseau ministry with an
important part of its majority in the Chamber, violently attacked
the alliance of the Republic with a reactionary autocracy.
However anomalous that may have been it did not prevent the
whole French nation from welcoming the friendship between
the governments of Russia and of France in its early stages.
Nor can there be any doubt that the popular instinct was right
in according it that welcome. France in its international relations
was strengthened morally by the understanding and by
the alliance, which also served as a check to Germany. But
its association with Russia had not the results hoped for by
the French reactionaries. It encouraged them in their opposition
to the parliamentary Republic during the Dreyfus agitation,
the more so because the Russian autocracy is anti-Semitic. It
also made a Nationalist of one president of the Republic, Félix
Faure, whose head was so turned by his imperial frequentations
that he adopted some of the less admirable practices of princes,
and also seemed ready to assume the bearing of an autocrat.
His sudden death was as great a relief to the parliamentary
Republicans as it was a disappointment to the plebiscitary
party, which anti-Dreyfusism, with its patriotic pretensions,
had again made a formidable force in the land. But the election
of the pacific and constitutional M. Loubet as president of the
Republic at this critical moment in its history counteracted
any reactionary influence which the Russian alliance might have
had in France; so the general effect of the alliance was to
strengthen the Republic and to add to its prestige. The visit
of the tsar to Paris, the first paid by a friendly sovereign since
the Second Empire, impressed a population, proud of its capital,
by an outward sign which seemed to show that the Republic
was not an obstacle to the recognition by the monarchies of
Europe of the place still held by France among the great powers.
Before M. Loubet laid down office the nation, grown more
republican, saw the visit of the tsar followed by those of the
kings of England and of Italy, who might never have been
moved to present their respects to the French Republic had not
Russia shown them the way.</p>

<p>While the French rejoiced at the Russian alliance chiefly as
a check to the aggressive designs of Germany, they also liked
the association of France with a power regarded as
hostile to England. This traditional feeling was not
<span class="sidenote">Relations with England.</span>
discouraged by one of the chief artificers of the alliance,
Baron Mohrenheim, Russian ambassador in Paris,
who until 1884 had filled the same position in London, where he
had not learned to love England, and who enjoyed in France a
popularity rarely accorded to the diplomatic agent of a foreign
power. An <i>entente cordiale</i> has since been initiated between
England and France. But it is necessary to refer to the less
agreeable relations which existed between the two countries,
as they had some influence on the exterior policy of the Third
Republic. England and France had no causes of friction within
Europe. But in its policy of colonial expansion, during the last
twenty years of the 19th century, France constantly encountered
England all over the globe. The first important enterprise beyond
the seas seriously undertaken by France after the Franco-German
War, was, as we have seen, in Tunis. But even before
that question had been mentioned at the congress of Berlin,
in 1878, France had become involved in an adventure in the Far
East, which in its developments attracted more public attention
at home than the extension of French territory in northern
Africa. Had these pages been written before the end of the
19th century it would have seemed necessary to trace the
operations of France in Indo-China with not less detail than
has been given to the establishment of the protectorate in Tunis.
But French hopes of founding a great empire in the Far East
came to an end with the partial resuscitation of China and the
rise to power of Japan. As we have seen, Jules Ferry&rsquo;s idea
was that in colonial expansion France would find the best means
of recovering prestige after the defeat of 1870-71 in the years
of recuperation when it was essential to be diverted from European
complications. Jules Ferry was not a friend of Gambetta, in
spite of later republican legends. But the policy of colonial
expansion in Tunis and in Indo-China, associated with Ferry&rsquo;s
name, was projected by Gambetta to give satisfaction to France
for the necessity, imposed, in his opinion, on the French government,
of taking its lead in foreign affairs from Berlin. How
Jules Ferry developed that system we know now from Bismarck&rsquo;s
subsequent expressions of regret at Ferry&rsquo;s fall. He believed
that, had Ferry remained in power, an amicable arrangement
would have been made between France and Germany, a formal
agreement having been almost concluded to the effect that France
should maintain peaceable and friendly relations with Germany,
while Bismarck supported France in Tunis, in Indo-China and
generally in its schemes of oversea colonization. Even though the
friendly attitude of Germany towards those schemes was not
official the contrast was manifest between the benevolent tone
of the German press and that of the English, which was generally
hostile. Jules Ferry took his stand on the position that his
policy was one not of colonial conquest, but of colonial conservation,
that without Tunis, Algeria was insecure, that without
Tongking and Annam, there was danger of losing Cochin-China,
where the French had been in possession since 1861. It was on
the Tongking question that Ferry fell. On the 30th of March
1885, on the news of the defeat of the French troops at Lang-Son,
the Chamber refused to vote the money for carrying on the campaign
by a majority of 306 to 149. Since that day public opinion
in France has made amends to the memory of Jules Ferry.
His patriotic foresight has been extolled. Criticism has not been
spared for the opponents of his policy in parliament of whom
the most conspicuous, M. Clémenceau and M. Ribot, have survived
to take a leading part in public affairs in the 20th century.
The attitude of the Parisian press, which compared Lang-Son
with Sedan and Jules Ferry with Émile Ollivier, has been
generally deplored, as has that of the public which was ready
to offer violence to the fallen minister, and which was still so
hostile to him in 1887 that the congress at Versailles was persuaded
that there would be a revolution in Paris if it elected
&ldquo;the German Ferry&rdquo; president of the Republic. Nevertheless
his adversaries in parliament, in the press and in the street have
been justified&mdash;not owing to their superior sagacity, but owing
to a series of unexpected events which the most foreseeing
statesmen of the world never anticipated. The Indo-China
dream of Jules Ferry might have led to a magnificent empire in
the East to compensate for that which Dupleix lost and Napoleon
failed to reconquer.</p>

<p>The Russian alliance, which came at the time when Ferry&rsquo;s
policy was justified in the eyes of the public, too late for him
to enjoy any credit, gave a new impetus to the French idea
of establishing an empire in the Far East. In the opinion of all
the prophets of Europe the great international struggle in the
near future was to be that of England with Russia for the
possession of India. If Russia won, France might have a share
in the dismembered Indian empire, of which part of the frontier
now marched with that of French Indo-China, since Burma
had become British and Tongking French. Such aspirations were
not formulated in white-books or in parliamentary speeches.
Indeed, the apprehension of difficulty with England limited
French ambition on the Siamese frontier. That did not prevent
dangerous friction arising between England and France on the
question of the Mekong, the river which flows from China almost
due south into the China Sea traversing the whole length of
French Indo-China, and forming part of the eastern boundary
of Upper Burma and Siam. The aim of France was to secure the
whole of the left bank of the Mekong, the highway of commerce
from southern China. The opposition of Siam to this delimitation
was believed by the French to be inspired by England, the
supremacy of France on the Mekong river being prejudicial to
British commerce with China. The inevitable rivalry between
the two powers reached an acute crisis in 1893, the British
ambassador in Paris being Lord Dufferin, who well understood
the question, upper Burma having been annexed to India under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page902" id="page902"></a>902</span>
his viceroyalty in 1885. The matter was not settled until 1894,
when not only was the French claim to the left bank of the
Mekong allowed, but the neutrality of a 25-kilometre zone on the
Siamese bank was conceded as open to French trade. It is said
that at one moment in July 1893 England and France were more
nearly at war than at any other international crisis under the
Third Republic, not excluding that of Fashoda, though the acute
tension between the governments was unknown to the public.</p>

<p>The Panama affair had left French public opinion in a nervous
condition. Fantastic charges were brought not only in the
press, but in the chamber of deputies, against newspapers and
politicians of having accepted bribes from the British government.
At the general election in August and September 1893
M. Clémenceau was pursued into his distant constituency in the
Var by a crowd of Parisian politicians, who brought about his
defeat less by alleging his connexion with the Panama scandal
than by propagating the legend that he was the paid agent of
England. The official republic, which changed its prime minister
three times and its foreign minister twice in 1893, M. Develle
filling that post in the Ribot and Dupuy ministries and M.
Casimir-Périer in his own, repudiated with energy the calumnies
as to the attempted interference of England in French domestic
affairs. But the successive governments were not in a mood to
make concessions in foreign questions, as all France was under
the glamour of the preliminary manifestations of the Russian
alliance. This was seen, a few weeks after the elections, in the
wild enthusiasm with which Paris received Admiral Avelane
and his officers, who had brought the Russian fleet to Toulon to
return the visit of the French fleet to Kronstadt in 1891. The
death of Marshal MacMahon, who had won his first renown in the
Crimea, and his funeral at the Invalides while the Russians were
in Paris, were used to emphasize the fact that the allies before
Sebastopol were no longer friends. The projector of the French
empire in the Far East did not live to see this phase of the seeming
justification of the policy which had cost him place and popularity.
Jules Ferry had died on the 17th of March 1893, only three weeks
after his triumphant rehabilitation in the political world by his
election to the presidency of the Senate, the second post in the
state. The year he died it seemed as though with the active
aid of Russia and the sympathy of Germany the possessions of
France in south-eastern Asia might have indefinitely expanded
into southern China. A few years later the defeat of Russia
by Japan and the rise of the sea-power of the Japanese practically
ended the French empire in Indo-China. What the French
already had at the end of the last century is virtually guaranteed
to them only by the Anglo-Japanese alliance. It is in the irony
of things that these possessions which were a sign of French rivalry
with England should now be secured to France by England&rsquo;s
friendliness. For it is now recognized by the French that the
defence of Indo-China is impossible.</p>

<p>Had the French dream been realized of a large expansion of
territory into southern China, the success of the new empire would
have been based on free Chinese labour. This might
have counterbalanced an initial obstacle to all French
<span class="sidenote">African policy.</span>
colonial schemes, more important than those which
arise from international difficulties&mdash;the reluctance of the
French to establish themselves as serious colonists in their
oversea possessions. We have noted how Algeria, which is
nearer to Toulon and Marseilles than are Paris and Havre,
has been comparatively neglected by the French, after eighty
years of occupation, in spite of the amenity of its climate and
its soil for European settlers. The new French colonial school
advocates the withdrawal of France from adventures in distant
tropical countries which can be reached only by long sea voyages,
and the concentration of French activity in the northern half
of the African continent. Madagascar is, as we have seen,
counted as Africa in computing the area of French colonial
territory. But it lies entirely outside the scheme of African
colonization, and in spite of the loss of life and money incurred
in its conquest, its retention is not popular with the new school,
although the first claim of France to it was as long ago as the
reign of Louis XIII., when in 1642 a company was founded under
the protection of Richelieu for the colonization of the island.
The French of the 19th and 20th centuries may well be considered
less enterprising in both hemispheres than were their ancestors
of the 17th, and Madagascar, after having been the cause of
much ill-feeling between England and France under the Third
Republic down to the time of its formal annexation, by the
law of the 9th of August 1896, is not now the object of much
interest among French politicians. On the African continent
it is different. When the Republic succeeded to the Second
Empire the French African possessions outside Algiers were
inconsiderable in area. The chief was Senegal, which though
founded as a French station under Louis XIII., was virtually
the creation of Faidherbe under the Second Empire, even in
a greater degree than were Tunis and Tongking of Jules Ferry
under the Third Republic. There was also Gabun, which is
now included in French Congo. Those outposts in the tropics
became the starting-points for the expansion of a French sphere
of influence in north Africa, which by the beginning of the 20th
century made France the nominal possessor of a vast territory
stretching from the equatorial region on the gulf of Guinea to
the Mediterranean. A large portion of it is of no importance,
including the once mysterious Timbuktu and the wilds of the
waterless Sahara desert. But the steps whereby these wide
<span class="sidenote">French and English rivalry.</span>
tracts of wilderness and of valuable territory came to
be marked on the maps in French colours, by international
agreement, are important, as they were
associated with the last serious official dispute between
England and France before the period of <i>entente</i>. M. Hanotaux,
who was foreign minister for the then unprecedented term of
four years, from 1894 to 1898, with one short interval of a few
months, has thrown an instructive light on the feeling with which
French politicians up to the end of the 19th century regarded
England. He declared in 1909, with the high authority of
one who was during years of Anglo-French tension the mouthpiece
of the Republic in its relations with other powers, that
every move in the direction of colonial expansion made by
France disquieted and irritated England. He complained
that when France, under the stimulating guidance of Jules
Ferry, undertook the reconstitution of an oversea domain,
England barred the way&mdash;in Egypt, in Tunis, in Madagascar,
in Indo-China, in the Congo, in Oceania. Writing with the
knowledge of an ex-foreign minister, who had enjoyed many
years of retirement to enable him to weigh his words, M.
Hanotaux asserted without any qualification that when he
took office England &ldquo;had conceived a triple design, to assume
the position of heir to the Portuguese possessions in Africa,
to destroy the independence of the South African republics,
and to remain in perpetuity in Egypt.&rdquo; We have not to discuss
the truth of those propositions, we have only to note the tendency
of French policy; and in so doing it is useful to remark that the
official belief of the Third Republic in the last period of the
19th century was that England was the enemy of French colonial
expansion all over the globe, and that in the so-called scramble
for Africa English ambition was the chief obstacle to the schemes
of France. M. Hanotaux, with the authority of official knowledge,
indicated that the English project of a railway from the
Cape of Good Hope to Cairo was the provocation which stimulated
the French to essay a similar adventure; though he denied
that the Marchand mission and other similar expeditions about
to be mentioned were conceived with the specific object of
preventing the accomplishment of the British plan. The explorations
of Stanley had demonstrated that access to the Great Lakes
and the Upper Nile could be effected as easily from the west
coast of Africa as from other directions. The French, from their
ancient possession of Gabun, had extended their operations far
to the east, and had by treaties with European powers obtained
the right bank of the Ubanghi, a great affluent of the Congo,
as a frontier between their territory and that of the Congo
Independent State. They thus found themselves, with respect
to Europe, in possession of a region which approached the
valley of the Upper Nile. Between the fall of Jules Ferry
in 1885 and the beginning of the Russian alliance came a period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page903" id="page903"></a>903</span>
of decreased activity in French colonial expansion. The unpopularity
of the Tongking expedition was one of the causes
of the popularity of General Boulanger, who diverted the French
public from distant enterprises to a contemplation of the German
frontier, and when Boulangism came to an end the Panama
affair took its place in the interest it excited. But the colonial
party in France did not lose sight of the possibility of establishing
<span class="sidenote">Upper Nile exploration.</span>
a position on the Upper Nile. The partition of Africa
seemed to offer an occasion for France to take compensation
for the English occupation of Egypt. In
1892 the Budget Commission, on the proposal of
M. Étienne, deputy for Oran, who had three times been colonial
under secretary, voted 300,000 francs for the despatch of a
mission to explore and report on those regions, which had not
had much attention since the days of Emin. But the project
was not then carried out. Later, parliament voted a sum six
times larger for strengthening the French positions on the Upper
Ubanghi and their means of communication with the coast.
But Colonel Monteil&rsquo;s expedition, which was the consequence
of this vote, was diverted, and the 1,800,000 francs were spent
at Loango, the southern port of French Congo, and on the Ivory
Coast, the French territory which lies between Liberia and
the British Gold Coast Colony, where a prolonged war ensued
with Samory, a Nigerian chieftain. In September 1894, M.
Delcassé being colonial minister, M. Liotard was appointed
commissioner of the Upper Ubanghi with instructions to extend
French influence in the Bahr-el-Ghazal up to the Nile. In
addition to official missions, numerous expeditions of French
explorers took place in Central Africa during this period, and
negotiations were continually going on between the British
and French governments. Towards the end of 1895 Lord Salisbury,
who had succeeded Lord Kimberley at the foreign office,
informed Baron de Courcel, the French ambassador, that an
expedition to the Upper Nile was projected for the purpose of
putting an end to Mahdism. M. Hanotaux was not at this
moment minister of foreign affairs. He had been succeeded
by M. Berthelot, the eminent chemist, who resigned that office
on the 26th of March 1896, a month before the fall of the Bourgeois
cabinet of which he was a member, in consequence of a
question raised in the chamber on this subject of the English
expedition to the Soudan. According to M. Hanotaux, who
returned to the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay, in the Méline ministry, on the
29th of April 1896, Lord Salisbury at the end of the previous
year, in announcing the expedition confidentially to M. de
Courcel, had assured him that it would not go beyond Dongola
without a preliminary understanding with France. There must
have been a misunderstanding on this point, as after reaching
Dongola in September 1896 the Anglo-Egyptian army proceeded
up the Nile in the direction of Khartoum. Before M. Hanotaux
<span class="sidenote">Marchand mission.</span>
resumed office the Marchand mission had been formally
planned. On the 24th of February 1896 M. Guieysse,
colonial minister in the Bourgeois ministry, had signed
Captain Marchand&rsquo;s instructions to the effect that he must
march through the Upper Ubanghi, in order to extend French
influence as far as the Nile, and try to reach that river
before Colonel Colvile, who was leading an expedition from
the East. He was also advised to conciliate the Mahdi if the aim
of the mission could be benefited thereby. M. Liotard was
raised to the rank of governor of the Upper Ubanghi, and in
a despatch to him the new colonial minister, M. André Lebon,
wrote that the Marchand mission was not to be considered a
military enterprise, it being sent out with the intention of
maintaining the political line which for two years M. Liotard
had persistently been following, and of which the establishment
of France in the basin of the Nile ought to be the crowning
reward. Two days later, on the 25th of June 1896, Captain
Marchand embarked for Africa. This is not the place for a
description of his adventures in crossing the continent or when
<span class="sidenote">Fashoda.</span>
he encountered General Kitchener at Fashoda, two
months after his arrival there in July 1898 and a
fortnight after the battle of Omdurman and the capture of
Khartoum. The news was made known to Europe by the
sirdar&rsquo;s telegrams to the British government in September
announcing the presence of the French mission at Fashoda.
Then ensued a period of acute tension between the French and
English governments, which gave the impression to the public
that war between the two countries was inevitable. But those
who were watching the situation in France on the spot knew
that there was no question of fighting. France was unprepared,
and was also involved in the toils of the Dreyfus affair. Had
the situation been that of a year later, when the French domestic
controversy was ending and the Transvaal War beginning,
England might have been in a very difficult position. General
Kitchener declined to recognize a French occupation of any
part of the Nile valley. A long discussion ensued between the
British and French governments, which was ended by the latter
deciding on the 6th of November 1898 not to maintain the
Marchand mission at Fashoda. Captain Marchand refused to
return to Europe by way of the Nile and Lower Egypt, marching
across Abyssinia to Jibuti in French Somaliland, where he
embarked for France. He was received with well-merited
enthusiasm in Paris. But the most remarkable feature of his
reception was that the ministry became so alarmed lest the
popularity of the hero of Fashoda should be at the expense
of that of the parliamentary republic, that it put an end to the
public acclamations by despatching him secretly from the
capital&mdash;a somewhat similar treatment having been accorded to
General Dodds in 1893 on his return to France after conquering
Dahomey. The Marchand mission had little effect on African
questions at issue between France and Great Britain, as a great
<span class="sidenote">Convention of 1898.</span>
settlement had been effected while it was on its way
across the continent. On the 14th of June 1898, the
day before the fall of the Méline ministry, when M.
Hanotaux finally quitted the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay, a convention
of general delimitation was signed at Paris by that minister
and by the British ambassador, Sir Edmund Monson, which as
regards the respective claims of England and France covered
in its scope the whole of the northern half of Africa from Senegambia
and the Congo to the valley of the Nile. Comparatively
little attention was paid to it amid the exciting events which
followed, so little that M. de Courcel has officially recorded
that three months later, on the eve of the Fashoda incident,
Lord Salisbury declared to him that he was not sufficiently
acquainted with the geography of Africa to express an opinion
on certain questions of delimitation arising out of the success
of the British expedition on the Upper Nile. The convention
of June 1898 was, however, of the highest importance, as it
affirmed the junction into one vast territory of the three chief
African domains of France, Algeria and Tunis, Senegal and the
Niger, Chad and the Congo, thus conceding to France the whole
of the north-western continent with the exception of Morocco,
Liberia and the European colonies on the Atlantic. This
arrangement, which was completed by an additional convention
on the 21st of March 1899, made Morocco a legitimate object
of French ambition.</p>

<p>The other questions which caused mutual animosity between
England and France in the decline of the 19th century had
nothing whatever to do with their conflicting international
interests. The offensive attitude of the
<span class="sidenote">The entente with England.</span>
English press towards France on account of the
Dreyfus affair was repaid by the French in their
criticism of the Boer War. When those sentimental causes of
mutual irritation had become less acute, the press of the two
countries was moved by certain influences to recognize that it
was in their interest to be on good terms with one another.
The importance of their <span class="correction" title="amended from commerical">commercial</span> relations was brought
into relief as though it were a new fact. At last in 1903 state
visits between the rulers of England and of France took place
in their respective capitals, for the first time since the early days
of the Second Empire, followed by an Anglo-French convention
signed on the 8th of April 1904. By this an arrangement was
come to on outstanding questions of controversy between
England and France in various parts of the world. France
undertook not to interfere with the action of England in Egypt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page904" id="page904"></a>904</span>
while England made a like undertaking as to French influence
in Morocco. France conceded certain of its fishing rights in
Newfoundland which had been a perpetual source of irritation
between the two countries for nearly two hundred years since
the treaty of Utrecht of 1713. In return England made several
concessions to France in Africa, including that of the Los
Islands off Sierra Leone and some rectifications of frontier on
the Gambia and between the Niger and Lake Chad. Other
points of difference were arranged as to Siam, the New Hebrides
and Madagascar. The convention of 1904 was on the whole
more advantageous for England than for France. The free
hand which England conceded to France in dealing with Morocco
was a somewhat burdensome gift owing to German interference;
but the incidents which arose from the Franco-German conflict
in that country are as yet too recent for any estimate of their
possible consequences.</p>

<p>One result was the retirement of M. Delcassé from the foreign
office on the 6th of June 1905. He had been foreign minister
for seven years, a consecutive period of rare length,
only once exceeded in England since the creation of
<span class="sidenote">The work of M. Delcassé.</span>
the office, when Castlereagh held it for ten years,
and one of prodigious duration in the history of the
Third Republic. He first went to the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay in the Brisson
ministry of June 1898, remained there during the Dupuy ministry
of the same year, was reappointed by M. Waldeck-Rousseau
in his cabinet which lasted from June 1899 to June 1902, was
retained in the post by M. Combes till his ministry fell in January
1905, and again by his successor M. Rouvier till his own resignation
in June of that year. M. Delcassé had thus an uninterrupted reign
at the foreign office during a long critical period of transition
both in the interior politics of France and in its exterior relations.
He went to the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay when the Dreyfus agitation was
most acute, and left it when parliament was absorbed in discussing
the separation of church and state. He saw the Franco-Russian
alliance lose its popularity in the country even before the
Russian defeat by the Japanese in the last days of his ministry.
Although in the course of his official duties at the colonial office
he had been partly responsible for some of the expeditions sent
to Africa for the purpose of checking British influence, he was
fully disposed to pursue a policy which might lead to a friendly
understanding with England. In this he differed from M.
Hanotaux, who was essentially the man of the Franco-Russian
alliance, owing to it much of his prestige, including his election
to the French Academy, and Russia, to which he gave exclusive
allegiance, was then deemed to be primarily the enemy of
England. M. Delcassé on the contrary, from the first, desired to
assist a <i>rapprochement</i> between England and Russia as preliminary
to the arrangement he proposed between England
and France. He was foreign minister when the tsar paid his
second visit to France, but there was no longer the national
unanimity which welcomed him in 1896, M. Delcassé also accompanied
President Loubet to Russia when he returned the tsar&rsquo;s
second visit in 1902. But exchange of compliments between
France and Russia were no longer to be the sole international
ceremonials within the attributes of the French foreign office;
M. Delcassé was minister when the procession of European
sovereigns headed by the kings of England and of Italy in 1903
came officially to Paris, and he went with M. Loubet to London
and to Rome on the president&rsquo;s return visits to those capitals&mdash;the
latter being the immediate cause of the rupture of the concordat
with the Vatican, though M. Delcassé was essentially a
concordatory minister. His retirement from the Rouvier
ministry in June 1905 was due to pressure from Germany in
consequence of his opposition to German interference in Morocco.
His resignation took place just a week after the news had arrived
of the destruction of the Russian fleet by the Japanese, which
completed the disablement of the one ally of France. The
impression was current in France that Germany wished to give
the French nation a fright before the understanding with England
had reached an effective stage, and it was actually believed
that the resignation of M. Delcassé averted a declaration of war.
Although that belief revived to some extent the fading enmity
of the French towards the conquerors of Alsace-Lorraine, the
fear which accompanied it moved a considerable section of the
nation to favour an understanding with Germany in preference
to, or even at the expense of, friendly relations with England.
M. Clémenceau, who only late in life came into office, and
attained it at the moment when a better understanding with
England was progressing, had been throughout his long career,
of all French public men in all political groups, the most consistent
friend of England. His presence at the head of affairs
was a guarantee of amicable Anglo-French relations, so far as
they could be protected by statesmanship.</p>

<p>By reason of the increased duration and stability of ministries,
the personal influence of ministers in directing the foreign policy
of France has in one sense become greater in the 20th century
than in those earlier periods when France had first to recuperate
its strength after the war and then to take its exterior policy
from Germany. Moreover, not only have cabinets lasted longer,
but the foreign minister has often been retained in a succession
of them. Of the thirty years which in 1909 had elapsed since
Marshal MacMahon retired and the republic was governed by
republicans, in the first fifteen years from 1879 to 1894 fourteen
different persons held the office of minister of foreign affairs,
while six sufficed for the fifteen years succeeding the latter date.
One must not, however, exaggerate the effect of this greater
stability in office-holding upon continuity of policy, which was
well maintained even in the days when there was on an average
a new foreign minister every year. Indeed the most marked
breach in the continuity of the foreign policy of France has been
made in that later period of long terms of office, which, with the
repudiation of the Concordat, has seen the withdrawal of the
French protectorate over Roman Catholic missions in the East&mdash;though
it is too soon to estimate the result. In another respect
France has under the republic departed a long way from a tradition
of the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay. It no longer troubles itself on the
subject of nationalities. Napoleon III., who had more French
temperament than French blood in his constitution, was an
idealist on this question, and one of the causes of his own downfall
and the defeat of France was his sympathy in this direction
with German unity. Since Sedan little has been done in France
to further the doctrine of nationalities. A faint echo of it was
heard during the Boer war, but French sympathy with the
struggling Dutch republics of South Africa was based rather on
anti-English sentiment than on any abstract theory.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography of French History.</span>&mdash;The scientific study of
the history of France only begins with the 16th century. It was
hampered at first by the traditions of the middle ages and by a
servile imitation of antiquity. Paulus Aemilius of Verona (<i>De
rebus gestis Francorum</i>, 1517), who may be called the first of modern
historians, merely applies the oratorical methods of the Latin
historiographers. It is not till the second half of the century that
history emancipates itself; Catholics and Protestants alike turn
to it for arguments in their religious and political controversies.
François Hotman published (1574) his <i>Franco-Gallia</i>; Claude
Fauchet his <i>Antiquités gauloises et françoises</i> (1579); Étienne
Pasquier his <i>Recherches de la France</i> (1611), &ldquo;the only work of
erudition of the 16th century which one can read through without
being bored.&rdquo; Amateurs like Petau, A. de Thou, Bongars and
Peiresc collected libraries to which men of learning went to draw
their knowledge of the past; Pierre Pithou, one of the authors of
the <i>Satire Ménippée</i>, published the earliest annals of France (<i>Annales
Francorum</i>, 1588, and <i>Historiae Francorum scriptores coetanei XI.</i>,
1596), Jacques Bongars collected in his <i>Gesta Dei per Francos</i> (1611-1617)
the principal chroniclers of the Crusades. Others made a
study of chronology like J.J. Scaliger (<i>De emendatione temporum</i>,
1583; <i>Thesaurus temporum</i>, 1606), sketched the history of literature,
like François Grudé, sieur of La Croix in Maine (<i>Bibliothèque françoise</i>,
1584), and Antoine du Verdier (<i>Catalogue de tous les auteurs qui ont
écrit ou traduit en français</i>, 1585), or discussed the actual principles of
historical research, like Jean Bodin (<i>Methodus ad facilem historiarum
cognitionem</i>, 1566) and Henri Lancelot Voisin de La Popelinière
(<i>Histoire des histoires</i>, 1599).</p>

<p>But the writers of history are as yet very inexpert; the <i>Histoire
générale des rois de France</i> of Bernard de Girard, seigneur de Haillan
(1576), the <i>Grandes Annales de France</i> of François de Belleforest
(1579), the <i>Inventaire général de l&rsquo;histoire de France</i> of Jean de Serres
(1597), the <i>Histoire générale de France depuis Pharamond</i> of Scipion
Dupleix (1621-1645), the <i>Histoire de France</i> (1643-1651) of François
Eudes de Mézeray, and above all his <i>Abrégé chronologique de l&rsquo;histoire</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page905" id="page905"></a>905</span>
<i>de France</i> (1668), are compilations which were eagerly read when they
appeared, but are worthless nowadays. Historical research lacked
method, leaders and trained workers; it found them all in the 17th
century, the golden age of learning which was honoured alike by
laymen, priests and members of the monastic orders, especially the
Benedictines of the congregation of St Maur. The publication of
original documents was carried on with enthusiasm. To André
Duchesne we owe two great collections of chronicles: the <i>Historiae
Normannorum scriptores antiqui</i> (1619) and the <i>Historiae Francorum
scriptores</i>, continued by his son François (5 vols., 1636-1649).
These publications were due to a part only of his prodigious activity;
his papers and manuscripts, preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale
at Paris, are an inexhaustible mine. Charles du Fresne, seigneur
du Cange, published Villehardouin (1657) and Joinville (1668);
Étienne Baluze, the <i>Capitularia regum Francorum</i> (1674), the <i>Nova
collectio conciliorum</i> (1677), the <i>Vitae paparum Avenionensium</i>
(1693). The clergy were very much aided in their work by their
private libraries and by their co-operation; Père Philippe Labbe
published his <i>Bibliotheca nova manuscriptorum</i> (1657), and began
(1671) his <i>Collection des conciles</i>, which was successfully completed
by his colleague Père Cossart (18 vols.). In 1643 the Jesuit Jean
Bolland brought out vol. i. of the <i>Acta sanctorum</i>, a vast collection
of stories and legends which has not yet been completed beyond the
4th of November. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bollandists</a></span>.) The Benedictines, for
their part, published the <i>Acta sanctorum ordinis sancti Benedicti</i>
(9 vols., 1668-1701). One of the chief editors of this collection, Dom
Jean Mabillon, published on his own account the Vetera analecta
(4 vols., 1675-1685) and prepared the <i>Annales ordinis sancti Benedicti</i>
(6 vols., 1703-1793). To Dom Thierri Ruinart we owe good editions
of Gregory of Tours and Fredegarius (1699). The learning of the
17th century further inaugurated those specialized studies which are
important aids to history. Mabillon in his <i>De re diplomatica</i> (1681)
creates the science of documents or diplomatics. Adrien de Valois
lays a sound foundation for historical geography by his critical
edition of the <i>Notitia Galliarum</i> (1675). Numismatics finds an enlightened
pioneer in François Leblanc (<i>Traité historique des monnaies
de France</i>, 1690). Du Cange, one of the greatest of the French
scholars who have studied the middle ages, has defined terms
bearing on institutions in his <i>Glossarium mediae et infimae latinitatis</i>
(1678), recast by the Benedictines (1733), with an important supplement
by Dom Carpentier (1768), republished twice during the 19th
century, with additions, by F. Didot (1840-1850), and by L. Favre at
Niort (1883-1888); this work is still indispensable to every student
of medieval history. Finally, great biographical or bibliographical
works were undertaken; the <i>Gallia christiana</i>, which gave a chronological
list of the archbishops, bishops and abbots of the Gauls and
of France, was compiled by two twin brothers, Scévole and Louis
de Sainte-Marthe, and by the two sons of Louis (4 vols., 1656); a
fresh edition, on a better plan, and with great additions, was begun
in 1715 by Denys de Sainte-Marthe, continued throughout the 18th
century by the Benedictines, and finished in the 19th century by
Barthélemy Hauréau (1856-1861).</p>

<p>As to the nobility, a series of researches and publications, begun
by Pierre d&rsquo;Hozier (d. 1660) and continued well on into the 19th
century by several of his descendants, developed into the <i>Armorial
général de la France</i>, which was remodelled several times. A similar
work, of a more critical nature, was carried out by Père Anselme
(<i>Histoire généalogique de la maison de France et des grands officiers
de la couronne</i>, 1674) and by Père Ange and Père Simplicien, who
completed the work (3rd ed. in 9 vols., 1726-1733). Critical bibliography
is especially represented by certain Protestants, expelled
from France by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Pierre
Bayle, the sceptic, famous for his <i>Dictionnaire critique</i> (1699),
which is in part a refutation of the <i>Dictionnaire historique et géographique</i>
published in 1673 by the Abbé Louis Moréri, was the
first to publish the <i>Nouvelles de la république des lettres</i> (1684-1687),
which was continued by Henri Basnage de Beauval under the title
of <i>Histoire des ouvrages des savants</i> (24 vols.). In imitation of this,
Jean Le Clerc successively edited a <i>Bibliothèque universelle et historique</i>
(1686-1693), a <i>Bibliothèque choisie</i> (1703-1713), and a <i>Bibliothèque
ancienne et moderne</i> (1714-1727). These were the first of our
&ldquo;periodicals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 18th century continues the traditions of the 17th. The
Benedictines still for some time hold the first place. Dom Edmond
Martène visited numerous archives (which were then closed) in
France and neighbouring countries, and drew from them the material
for two important collections: <i>Thesaurus novus anecdotorum</i> (9 vols.,
1717, in collaboration with Dom Ursin Durand) and <i>Veterum scriptorum
collectio</i> (9 vols., 1724-1733). Dom Bernard de Montfaucon
also travelled in search of illustrated records of antiquity; private
collections, among others the celebrated collection of Gaignières
(now in the Bibliothèque Nationale), provided him with the illustrations
which he published in his <i>Monuments de la monarchie
françoise</i> (5 vols., 1729-1733). The text is in two languages, Latin
and French. Dom Martin Bouquet took up the work begun by the
two Duchesnes, and in 1738 published vol. i. of the Historians of
France (<i>Rerum Gallicarum et Francicarum scriptores</i>), an enormous
collection which was intended to include all the sources of the history
of France, grouped under centuries and reigns. He produced the
first eight volumes himself; his work was continued by several
collaborators, the most active of whom was Dom Michel J. Brial,
and already comprised thirteen volumes when it was interrupted
by the Revolution. In 1733, Antoine Rivet de La Grange produced
vol. i. of the <i>Histoire littéraire de la France</i>, which in 1789 numbered
twelve volumes. While Dom C. François Toustaint and Dom
René Prosper Tassin published a <i>Nouveau Traité de diplomatique</i>
(6 vols., 1750-1765), others were undertaking the <i>Art de vérifier les
dates</i> (1750; new and much enlarged edition in 1770). Still others,
with more or less success, attempted histories of the provinces.</p>

<p>In the second half of the 18th century, the ardour of the Benedictines
of St Maur diminished, and scientific work passed more and
more into the hands of laymen. The Académie des Inscriptions et
Belles-lettres, founded in 1663 and reorganized in 1701, became its
chief instrument, numbering among its members Denis François
Secousse, who continued the collection of <i>Ordonnances des rois de
France</i>, begun (1723) by J. de Laurière; J.-B. de La Curne de Sainte
Palaye (<i>Mémoires sur l&rsquo;ancienne chevalerie</i>, 1759-1781; <i>Glossaire de
la langue française depuis son origine jusqu&rsquo;à la fin de Louis XIV</i>,
printed only in 1875-1882); J.-B. d&rsquo;Anville (<i>Notice sur l&rsquo;ancienne
Gaule tirée des monuments</i>, 1760); and L.G. de Bréquigny, the
greatest of them all, who continued the publication of the <i>Ordonnances</i>,
began the <i>Table chronologique des diplômes concernant
l&rsquo;histoire de France</i> (3 vols., 1769-1783), published the <i>Diplomata,
chartae, ad res Francicas spectantia</i> (1791, with the collaboration of
La Porte du Theil), and directed fruitful researches in the archives in
London, to enrich the <i>Cabinet des chartes</i>, where Henri Bertin (1719-1792),
an enlightened minister of Louis XV., had in 1764 set himself
the task of collecting the documentary sources of the national history.
The example set by the religious orders and the government bore
fruit. The general assembly of the clergy gave orders that its
<i>Procès verbaux</i> (9 vols., 1767-1789) should be printed; some of the
provinces decided to have their history written, and mostly applied
to the Benedictines to have this done. Brittany was treated by
Dom Lobineau (1707) and Dom Morice (1742); the duchy of Burgundy
by Dom Urbain Plancher (1739-1748); Languedoc by Dom
Dominique Vaissète (1730-1749, in collaboration with Dom Claude
de Vic; new ed. 1873-1893); for Paris, its secular history was
treated by Dom Michel Félibien and Dom Lobineau (1725), and its
ecclesiastical history by the abbé Lebeuf (1745-1760; new ed.
1883-1890).</p>

<p>This ever-increasing stream of new evidence aroused curiosity,
gave rise to pregnant comparisons, developed and sharpened the
critical sense, but further led to a more and more urgent need for
exact information. The Académie des Inscriptions brought out its
<i>Histoire de l&rsquo;Académie avec les mémoires de littérature tirés de ses
registres</i> (vol. i. 1717; 51 vols. appeared before the Revolution, with
five indexes; <i>vide</i> the <i>Bibliographie</i> of Lasteyrie, vol. iii. pp. 256 et
seq.). Other collections, mostly of the nature of bibliographies,
were the <i>Journal des savants</i> (111 vols., from 1665 to 1792; <i>vide</i> the
<i>Table méthodique</i> by H. Cocheris, 1860); the <i>Journal de Trévoux</i>, or
<i>Mémoires pour l&rsquo;histoire des sciences et des beaux-arts</i>, edited by
Jesuits (265 vols., 1701-1790); the <i>Mercure de France</i> (977 vols.,
from 1724 to 1791). To these must be added the dictionaries and
encyclopaedias: the <i>Dictionnaire de Moréri</i>, the last edition of
which numbers 10 vols. (1759); the <i>Dictionnaire géographique,
historique et politique des Gaules et de la France</i>, by the abbé J.J.
Expilly (6 vols., 1762-1770; unfinished); the <i>Répertoire universel
et raisonné de jurisprudence civile, criminelle, canonique et bénéficiale</i>,
by Guyot (64 vols., 1775-1786; supplement in 17 vols., 1784-1785),
reorganized and continued by Merlin de Douai, who was afterwards
one of the <i>Montagnards</i>, a member of the Directory, and a count
under the Empire.</p>

<p>The historians did not use to the greatest advantage the treasures
of learning provided for them; they were for the most part superficial,
and dominated by their political or religious prejudices.
Thus works like that of Père Gabriel Daniel (<i>Histoire de France</i>, 3
vols., 1713), of Président Hénault (<i>Abrégé chronologique</i>, 1744; 25
editions between 1770 and 1834), of the abbé Paul François Velly
and those who completed his work (<i>Histoire de France</i>, 33 vols.,
1765 to 1783), of G.H. Gaillard (<i>Histoire de la rivalité de la France
et de l&rsquo;Angleterre</i>, 11 vols., 1771-1777), and of L.P. Anquetil (1805),
in spite of the brilliant success with which they met at first, have
fallen into a just oblivion. A separate place must be given to the
works of the theorists and philosophers: <i>Histoire de l&rsquo;ancien gouvernement
de la France</i>, by the Comte de Boulainvilliers (1727), <i>Histoire
critique de l&rsquo;établissement de la monarchie françoise dans les deux
Gaules</i>, by the abbé J.B. Dubos (1734); <i>L&rsquo;Esprit des lois</i>, by the
président de Montesquieu (1748); the <i>Observations sur l&rsquo;histoire de
France</i>, by the abbé de Mably (1765); the <i>Théorie de la politique de
la monarchie française</i>, by Marie Pauline de Lézardière (1792). These
works have, if nothing else, the merit of provoking reflection.</p>

<p>At the time of the Revolution this activity was checked. The
religious communities and royal academies were suppressed, and
France violently broke with even her most recent past, which was
considered to belong to the <i>ancien régime</i>. When peace was re-established,
she began the task of making good the damage which
had been done, but a greater effort was now necessary in order to
revive the spirit of the institutions which had been overthrown.
The new state, which was, in spite of all, bound by so many ties
to the former order of things, seconded this effort, and during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page906" id="page906"></a>906</span>
whole of the 19th century, and even longer, had a strong influence on
historical production. The section of the Institut de France,
which in 1816 assumed the old name of Académie des Inscriptions
et Belles-lettres, began to reissue the two series of the <i>Mémoires</i>
and of the <i>Notices et extraits des manuscrits tirés de la bibliothèque
royale</i> (the first volume had appeared in 1787); began (1844) that
of the <i>Mémoires présentés par divers savants</i> and the <i>Comptes rendus</i>
(subject index 1857-1900, by G. Ledos, 1906); and continued the
<i>Recueil des historiens de France</i>, the plan of which was enlarged by
degrees (<i>Historiens des croisades, obituaires, pouillés, comptes</i>, &amp;c.),
the <i>Ordonnances</i> and the <i>Table chronologique des diplômes</i>. During
the reign of Louis Philippe, the ministry of the interior reorganized
the administration of the archives of the departments, communes
and hospitals, of which the <i>Inventaires sommaires</i> are a mine of
precious information (see the <i>Rapport au ministre</i>, by G. Servois,
1902). In 1834 the ministry of public instruction founded a committee,
which has been called since 1881 the Comité des Travaux
historiques et scientifiques, under the direction of which have been
published: (1) the <i>Collection des documents inédits relatifs à l&rsquo;histoire
de France</i> (more than 260 vols. have appeared since 1836); (2) the
<i>Catalogue général des manuscrits des bibliothèques de France</i>; (3)
the <i>Dictionnaires topographiques</i> (25 vols. have appeared); and the
<i>Répertoires archéologiques</i> of the French departments (8 vols. between
1861 and 1888); (4) several series of <i>Bulletins</i>, the details of which will
be found in the <i>Bibliographie</i> of Lasteyrie. At the same time were
founded or reorganized, both in Paris and the departments, numerous
societies, devoted sometimes partially and sometimes exclusively to
history and archaeology; the Académie Celtique (1804), which in
1813 became the Société des Antiquaires de France (general index by
M. Prou, 1894); the Société de l&rsquo;Histoire de France (1834); the
Société de l&rsquo;École des Chartes (1839); the Société de l&rsquo;Histoire de Paris
et de l&rsquo;Île-de-France (1874; four decennial indexes), &amp;c. The details
will be found in the excellent <i>Bibliographie générale des travaux
historiques et archéologiques publiés par les sociétés savantes de France</i>,
which has appeared since 1885 under the direction of Robert de
Lasteyrie.</p>

<p>Individual scholars also associated themselves with this great
literary movement. Guizot published a <i>Collection de mémoires
relatifs à l&rsquo;histoire de France</i> (31 vols., 1824-1835); Buchon, a
<i>Collection des chroniques nationales françaises écrites en langue
vulgaire du XIII<span class="sp">e</span> au XVI<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i> (47 vols., 1824-1829), and a
<i>Choix de chroniques et mémoires sur l&rsquo;histoire de France</i> (14 vols.,
1836-1841); Petitot and Monmerqué, a <i>Collection de mémoires
relatifs à l&rsquo;histoire de France</i> (131 vols., 1819-1829); Michaud and
Poujoulat, a <i>Nouvelle Collection de mémoires pour servir a l&rsquo;histoire
de France</i> (32 vols., 1836-1839); Barrière and de Lescure, a <i>Bibliothèque
de mémoires relatifs à l&rsquo;histoire de France pendant le XVIII<span class="sp">e</span>
siècle</i> (30 vols., 1855-1875); and finally Berville and Barrière, a
<i>Collection des mémoires relatifs à la Révolution Française</i> (55 vols.,
1820-1827). The details are to be found in the <i>Sources de l&rsquo;histoire
de France</i>, by Alfred Franklin (1876). The abbé J.P. Migne in his
<i>Patrologia Latina</i> (221 vols., 1844-1864), re-edited a number cf texts
anterior to the 13th century. Under the second empire, the administration
of the imperial archives at Paris published ten volumes
of documents (<i>Monuments historiques</i>, 1866; <i>Layettes du trésor des
chartes</i>, 1863, which were afterwards continued up to 1270; <i>Actes
du parlement de Paris</i>, 1863-1867), not to mention several volumes
of <i>Inventaires</i>. The administration of the Bibliothèque impériale
had printed the <i>Catalogue général de l&rsquo;histoire de France</i> (10 vols.,
1855-1870; vol. xi., containing the alphabetical index to the names
of the authors, appeared in 1895). Other countries also supplied
a number of useful texts; there is much in the English Rolls series,
in the collection of <i>Chroniques belges</i>, and especially in the <i>Monumenta
Germaniae historica</i>.</p>

<p>At the same time the scope of history and its auxiliary sciences
becomes more clearly defined; the École des Chartes produces some
excellent palaeographers, as for instance Natalis de Wailly (<i>Éléments
de paléographie</i>, 1838), and L. Delisle (<i>q.v.</i>), who has also left traces of
his profound researches in the most varied departments of medieval
history (<i>Bibliographie des travaux de M. Léopold Delisle</i>, 1902);
Anatole de Barthélemy made a study of coins and medals, Douët
d&rsquo;Arcq and G. Demay of seals. The works of Alexandre Lenoir
(<i>Musée des monuments français</i>, 1800-1822), of Arcisse de Caumont
(<i>Histoire de l&rsquo;architecture du moyen âge</i>, 1837; <i>Abécédaire ou rudiment
d&rsquo;archéologie</i>, 1850), of A. Napoléon Didron (<i>Annales archéologiques</i>,
1844), of Jules Quicherat (<i>Mélanges d&rsquo;archéologie et d&rsquo;histoire</i>, published
after his death, 1886), and the dictionaries of Viollet le Duc
(<i>Dictionnaire raisonné de l&rsquo;architecture française</i>, 1853-1868; <i>Dictionnaire
du mobilier français</i>, 1855) displayed to the best advantage
one of the most brilliant sides of the French intellect, while other
sciences, such as geology, anthropology, the comparative study of
languages, religions and folk-lore, and political economy, continued
to enlarge the horizon of history. The task of writing the general
history of a country became more and more difficult, especially
for one man, but the task was none the less undertaken by several
historians, and by some of eminence. François Guizot treated of
the <i>Histoire de la civilisation en France</i> (1828-1830); Augustin
Thierry after the <i>Récits des temps mérovingiens</i> (1840) published
the <i>Monuments de l&rsquo;histoire du tiers état</i> (1849-1856), the introduction
to which was expanded into a book (1855); Charles Simonde
de Sismondi produced a mediocre <i>Histoire des français</i> in 31 vols.
(1821-1844), and Henri Martin a <i>Histoire de France</i> in 16 vols.
(1847-1854), now of small use except for the two or three last centuries
of the <i>ancien régime</i>. Finally J. Michelet, in his <i>Histoire
de France</i> (17 vols., 1833-1856) and his <i>Histoire de la Révolution</i>
(7 vols., 1847-1853), aims at reviving the very soul of the nation&rsquo;s
past.</p>

<p>After the Franco-German War begins a better organization of
scientific studies, modelled on that of Germany. The École des
Hautes Études, established in 1868, included in its programme the
critical study of the sources, both Latin and French, of the history
of France; and from the <i>séminaire</i> of Gabriel Monod came men of
learning, already prepared by studying at the École des Chartes:
Paul Viollet, who revived the study of the history of French law;
Julien Havet, who revived that of Merovingian diplomatics; Arthur
Giry, who resumed the study of municipal institutions where it
had been left by A. Thierry, prepared the <i>Annales carolingiennes</i>
(written by his pupils, Eckel, Favre, Lauer, Lot, Poupardin), and
brought back into honour the study of diplomatics (<i>Manuel de
diplomatique</i>, 1894); Auguste Molinier, author of the <i>Sources de
l&rsquo;histoire de France</i> (1902-1904; general index, 1906), &amp;c. Auguste
Longnon introduced at the École des Hautes Études the study of
historical geography (<i>Atlas historique de la France</i>, in course of
publication since 1888). The universities, at last reorganized,
popularized the employment of the new methods. The books of
Fustel de Coulanges and Achille Luchaire on the middle ages, and
those of A. Aulard on the revolution, gave a strong, though well-regulated,
impetus to historical production. The École du Louvre
(1881) increased the value of the museums and placed the history
of art among the studies of higher education, while the Musée
archéologique of St-Germain-en-Laye offered a fruitful field for
research on Gallic and Gallo-Roman antiquities. Rich archives,
hitherto inaccessible, were thrown open to students; at Rome
those of the Vatican (<i>Registres pontificaux</i>, published by students
at the French school of archaeology, since 1884); at Paris, those of
the Foreign Office (<i>Recueil des instructions données aux ambassadeurs
depuis le traité de Westphalie</i>, 16 vols., 1885-1901; besides various
collections of diplomatic papers, inventories, &amp;c.). Those of the
War Office were used by officers who published numerous documents
bearing on the wars of the Revolution and the Empire, and on that of
1870-1871. In 1904 a commission, generously endowed by the
French parlement, was entrusted with the task of publishing the
documents relating to economic and social life of the time of the
Revolution, and four volumes had appeared by 1908. Certain
towns, Paris, Bordeaux, &amp;c., have made it a point of honour to have
their chief historical monuments printed. The work now becomes
more and more specialized. <i>L&rsquo;Histoire de France</i>, by Ernest Lavisse
(1900, &amp;c.), is the work of fifteen different authors. It is therefore
more than ever necessary that the work should be under sound
direction. The <i>Manuel de bibliographie historique</i> of Ch. V. Langlois
(2nd edition, 1901-1904) is a good guide, as is his <i>Archives de l&rsquo;histoire
de France</i> (1891, in collaboration with H. Stein).</p>

<p>Besides the special bibliographies mentioned above, it will be
useful to consult the <i>Bibliothèque historique</i> of Père Jacques Lelong
(1719; new ed. by Fevret de Fontette, 5 vols., 1768-1778); the
<i>Geschichte der historischen Forschung und Kunst</i> of Ludwig Wachler
(2 vols., 1812-1816); the <i>Bibliographie de la France</i>, established
in 1811 (1st series, 1811-1856, 45 vols.; 2nd series, 1 vol. per annum
since 1857); the publications of the Société de Bibliographie (<i>Polybiblion</i>,
from 1868 on, &amp;c.); the <i>Bibliographie de l&rsquo;histoire de France</i>,
by Gabriel Monod (1888); the <i>Répertoire</i> of the abbé Ulysse Chevalier
(<i>Biobibliographie</i>; new ed. 1903-1907; and <i>Topobibliographie</i>,
1894-1899). Bearing exclusively on the middle ages are the <i>Bibliotheca
historica medii aevi</i> of August Potthast (new ed. 1896) and the
<i>Manuel</i> (<i>Les Sources de l&rsquo;histoire de France</i>, 1901, &amp;c.) of A. Molinier;
but the latter is to be continued up to modern times, the 16th century
having already been begun by Henri Hausser (1st part, 1906).
Finally, various special reviews, besides teaching historical method
by criticism and by example, try to keep their readers <i>au courant</i>
with literary production; the <i>Revue critique d&rsquo;histoire et de littérature</i>
(1866 fol.), the <i>Revue des questions historiques</i> (1866 fol.), the <i>Revue
historique</i> (1876 fol.), the <i>Revue d&rsquo;histoire moderne et contemporaine</i>,
accompanied annually by a valuable <i>Répertoire méthodique</i> (1898
fol.); the <i>Revue de synthèse historique</i> (1900 fol.), &amp;c.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">French Law and Institutions</p>

<p><i>Celtic Period.</i>&mdash;The remotest times to which history gives us
access with reference to the law and institutions formerly
existing in the country which is now called France are those in
which the dominant race at least was Celtic. On the whole,
our knowledge is small of the law and institutions of these Celts,
or Gauls, whose tribes constituted independent Gaul. For their
reconstruction, modern scholars draw upon two sources; firstly,
there is the information furnished by the classical writers and by
Caesar and Strabo in particular, which is trustworthy but somewhat
scanty; the other source, which is not so pure, consists in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page907" id="page907"></a>907</span>
the accounts found in those legal works of the middle ages written
in the neo-Celtic dialects, the most important and the greater
number of which belong to Ireland. A reconstruction from them
is always hazardous, however delicate and scientific be the
criticism which is brought to bear on it, as in the case of d&rsquo;Arbois
de Jubainville, for example. Moreover, in the historical evolution
of French institutions those of the Celts or Gauls are of little
importance. Not one of them can be shown to have survived
in later law. What has survived of the Celtic race is the blood
and temperament, still found in a great many Frenchmen,
certain traits which the ancients remarked in the Gauls being
still recognizable: <i>bellum gerere et argute loqui</i>.</p>

<p><i>Roman Period.</i>&mdash;It was the Roman conquest and rule which
really formed Gaul, for she was Romanized to the point of losing
almost completely that which persists most stubbornly in a
conquered nation, namely, the language; the Breton-speaking
population came to France later, from Britain. The institutions
of Roman Gaul became identical with those of the Roman empire,
provincial and municipal government undergoing the same
evolution as in the other parts of the empire. It was under
Roman supremacy too, as M. d&rsquo;Arbois de Jubainville has shown,
that the ownership of land became personal and free in Gaul.
The law for the Gallo-Romans was that which was administered
by the <i>conventus</i> of the magistrate; there are only a few peculiarities,
mere Gallicisms, resulting from conventions or usage,
which are pointed out by Roman jurisconsults of the classical
age. The administrative reforms of Diocletian and Constantine
applied to Gaul as to the rest of the empire. Gaul under this
rule consisted of seventeen provinces, divided between two
dioceses, ten in the diocese of the Gauls, under the authority
of the praetorian prefect, who resided at Treves; and the other
seven in the <i>dioecesis septem provinciarum</i>, under the authority
of a <i>vicarius</i>. The Gallo-Romans became Christian with the
other subjects of the empire; the Church extended thither her
powerful organization modelled on the administrative organization,
each <i>civitas</i> having a bishop, just as it had a <i>curia</i> and
municipal magistrates. But, although endowed with privileges
by the Christian emperors, the Church did not yet encroach upon
the civil power. She had the right of acquiring property, of
holding councils, subject to the imperial authority, and of the
free election of bishops. But only the first germs of ecclesiastical
jurisdiction are to be traced. In virtue of the laws, the bishops
were privileged arbitrators, and in the matter of public sins
exercised a disciplinary jurisdiction over the clergy and the
faithful. In the second half of the 4th century, monasteries
appeared in Gaul. After the fall of the Western empire, there was
left to the Gallo-Romans as an expression of its law, which was
also theirs, a written legislation. It consisted of the imperial
constitutions, contained in the Gregorian, Hermogenian and
Theodosian codes (the two former being private compilations,
and the third an official collection), and the writings of the
five jurists (Gaius, Papinian, Paulus, Ulpian and Modestinus),
to which Valentinian III. had in 426 given the force of law.</p>

<p><i>The Barbarian Invasion.</i>&mdash;The invasions and settlements of
the barbarians open a new period. Though there were robbery
and violence in every case, the various barbarian kingdoms
set up in Gaul were established under different conditions.
In those of the Burgundians and Visigoths, the owners of the great
estates, which had been the prevailing form of landed property
in Roman Gaul, suffered partial dispossession, according to a
system the rules regulating which can, in the case of the Burgundians,
be traced almost exactly. It is doubtful whether a
similar process took place in the case of the Frankish settlements,
but their first conquests in the north and east seem to have led
to the extermination or total expulsion of the Gallo-Roman
population. It is impossible to say to what extent, in these
various settlements, the system of collective property prevailing
among the Germanic tribes was adopted. Another important
difference was that, in embracing Christianity, some of the
barbarians became Arians, as in the case of the Visigoths and
Burgundians; others Catholic, as in the case of the Franks.
This was probably the main cause of the absorption of the other
kingdoms into the Frankish monarchy. In each case, however,
the barbarian king appeared as wishing not to overthrow the
Roman administration, but to profit by its continuation. The
kings of the Visigoths and Burgundians were at first actually
representatives of the Western empire, and Clovis himself was
ready to accept from the emperor Anastasius the title of consul;
but these were but empty forms, similar to the fictitious ties
which long existed or still exist between China or Turkey and
certain parts of their former empires, now separated from them
for ever.</p>

<p>As soon as the Merovingian monarch had made himself master
of Gaul, he set himself to maintain and keep in working order
the administrative machinery of the Romans, save that the
administrative unit was henceforth no longer the <i>provincia</i> but
the <i>civitas</i>, which generally took the name of <i>pagus</i>, and was
placed under the authority of a count, <i>comes</i> or <i>grafio</i> (<i>Graf</i>).
Perhaps this was not entirely an innovation, for it appears that
at the end of the Roman supremacy certain <i>civitates</i> had already
a <i>comes</i>. Further, several <i>pagi</i> could be united under the
authority of a <i>dux</i>. The <i>pagus</i> seems to have generally been
divided into hundreds (<i>centenae</i>).</p>

<p>But the Roman administrative machinery was too delicate
to be handled by barbarians; it could not survive for long,
but underwent changes and finally disappeared. Thus the
Merovingians tried to levy the same direct taxes as the Romans
had done, the <i>capitatio terrena</i> and the <i>capitatio humana</i>, but
they ceased to be imposts reassessed periodically in accordance
with the total sum fixed as necessary to meet the needs of the
state, and became fixed annual taxes on lands or persons;
finally, they disappeared as general imposts, continuing to
exist only as personal or territorial dues. In the same way the
Roman municipal organization, that of the <i>curiae</i>, survived
for a considerable time under the Merovingians, but was used
only for the registration of written deeds; under the Carolingians
it disappeared, and with it the old senatorial nobility which
had been that of the Empire. The administration of justice
(apart from the king&rsquo;s tribunal) seems to have been organized
on a system borrowed partly from Roman and partly from
Germanic institutions; it naturally tends to assume popular
forms. Justice is administered by the count (<i>comes</i>) or his
deputy (<i>centenarius</i> or <i>vicarius</i>), but on the verdict of notables
called in the texts <i>boni homines</i> or <i>rachimburgii</i>. This takes
place in an assembly of all the free subjects, called <i>mallus</i>, at
which every free man is bound to attend at least a certain number
of times a year, and in which are promulgated the general acts
emanating from the king. The latter could issue commands
or prohibitions under the name of <i>bannus</i>, the violation of which
entailed a fine of 60 <i>solidi</i>; the king also administered justice
(<i>in palatio</i>), assisted by the officers of his household, his jurisdiction
being unlimited and at the same time undefined. He could
hear all causes, but was not bound to hear any, except, apparently,
accusations of deliberate failure of justice and breach of trust
on the part of the <i>rachimburgii</i>.</p>

<p>But what proved the great disturbing element in Gallo-Roman
society was the fact that the conquerors, owing to their former
customs and the degree of their civilization, were all warriors,
men whose chief interest was to become practised in the handling
of arms, and whose normal state was that of war. It is true
that under the Roman empire all the men of a <i>civitas</i> were
obliged, in case of necessity, to march against the enemy, and
under the Frankish monarchy the count still called together his
<i>pagenses</i> for this object. But the condition of the barbarian
was very different; he lived essentially for fighting. Hence
those gatherings or annual reviews of the <i>Campus Martius</i>,
which continued so long, in Austrasia at least. They constituted
the chief armed force; for mercenary troops, in spite of the
assertions of some to the contrary, play at this period only a
small part. But this military class, though not an aristocracy
(for among the Franks the royal race alone was noble), was
to a large extent independent, and the king had to attach
these <i>leudes</i> or <i>fideles</i> to himself by gifts and favours. At the
same time the authority of the king gradually underwent a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page908" id="page908"></a>908</span>
change in character, though he always claimed to be the
successor of the Roman emperor. It gradually assumed that
<span class="sidenote">Character of the Merovingian kingship.</span>
domestic or personal character that, among the
Germans, marked most of the relations between
men. The household of the king gained in political
importance, by reason that the heads of the principal
offices in the palace became at the same time high
public officials. There was, moreover, a body of men more
especially attached to the king, the <i>antrustions</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) and the
commensals (<i>convivae regis</i>) whose <i>weregeld</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the price of a
man&rsquo;s life in the system of compensation then prevalent) was three
times greater than that of the other subjects of the same race.</p>

<p>The Frankish monarch had also the power of making laws,
which he exercised after consulting the chief men of the kingdom,
both lay and ecclesiastical, in the <i>placita</i>, which were meetings
differing from the <i>Campus Martius</i> and apparently modelled
principally on the councils of the Church. But throughout the
kingdom in many places the direct authority of the king over
the people ceased to make itself felt. The <i>immunitates</i>, granted
chiefly to the great ecclesiastical properties, limited this authority
in a curious way by forbidding public officials to exercise their
functions in the precinct of land which was <i>immunis</i>. The
judicial and fiscal rights frequently passed to the landowner,
who in any case became of necessity the intermediary between
the supreme power and the people. In regard to this last point,
moreover, the case seems to have been the same with all the
great landowners or <i>potentes</i>, whose territory was called <i>potestas</i>,
and who gained a real authority over those living within it;
later in the middle ages they were called <i>homines potestatis</i>
(<i>hommes de poeste</i>).</p>

<p>Other principles, arising perhaps less from Germanic custom
strictly speaking than from an inferior level of civilization, also
contributed towards the weakening of the royal power. The
monarch, like his contemporaries, considered the kingdom and
the rights of the king over it to be his property; consequently,
he had the power of dealing with it as if it were a private possession;
it is this which gave rise to the concessions of royal rights
to individuals, and later to the partitions of the kingdom, and
then of the empire, between the sons of the king or emperor,
to the exclusion of the daughters, as in the division of an inheritance
in land. This proved one of the chief weaknesses of the
Merovingian monarchy.</p>

<p>In order to rule the Gallo-Romans, the barbarians had had
inevitably to ask the help of the Church, which was the representative
of Roman civilization. Further, the Merovingian
monarch and the Catholic Church had come
<span class="sidenote">Position of the Church.</span>
into close alliance in their struggle with the Arians.
The result for the Church had been that she gained new
privileges, but at the same time became to a certain extent
dependent. Under the Merovingians the election of the bishop
<i>a clero et populo</i> is only valid if it obtains the assent (<i>assensus</i>)
of the king, who often directly nominates the prelate. But at
the same time the Church retains her full right of acquiring
property, and has her jurisdiction partially recognized; that is to
say, she not only exercises more freely than ever a disciplinary
jurisdiction, but the bishop, in place of the civil power, administers
civil and criminal justice over the clergy. The councils
had for a long time forbidden the clergy to cite one another before
secular tribunals; they had also, in the 6th century, forbidden
secular judges under pain of excommunication to cite before them
and judge the clergy, without permission of the bishop. A
decree of Clotaire II. (614) acknowledged the validity of these
claims, but not completely; a precise interpretation of the text
is, however, difficult.</p>

<p>The Merovingian dynasty perished of decay, amid increasing
anarchy. The crown passed, with the approval of the papacy,
to an Austrasian mayor of the palace and his family,
one of those mayors of the palace (<i>i.e.</i> chief officer of
<span class="sidenote">Carolingian period.</span>
the king&rsquo;s household) who had been the last support
of the preceding dynasty. It was then that there
developed a certain number of institutions, which offered themselves
as useful means of consolidating the political organism,
and were in reality the direct precursors of feudalism. One was
the royal benefice (<i>beneficium</i>), of which, without doubt, the
Church provided both the model and, in the first instance, the
material. The model was the <i>precaria</i>, a form of concession by
which it was customary for the Church to grant the possession
of her lands to free men; this practice she herself had copied
from the five-years leases granted by the Roman exchequer.
Gradually, however, the <i>precaria</i> had become a concession made,
in most cases, free and for life. As regards the material, when
<span class="sidenote">Beginnings of the feudal system.</span>
the Austrasian mayors of the palace (probably Charles
Martel) wished to secure the support of the <i>fideles</i>
by fresh benefits, the royal treasury being exhausted,
they turned to the Church, which was at that time the
greatest landowner, and took lands from her to give to
their warriors. In order to disguise the robbery it was decided&mdash;perhaps
as an afterthought&mdash;that these lands should be held as
<i>precariae</i> from the Church, or from the monastic houses which
had furnished them. Later, when the royal treasury was
reorganized, the grants of land made by the kings naturally took
a similar form: the <i>beneficium</i>, as a free grant for life. Under the
Merovingians royal grants of land were in principle made in full
ownership, except, as Brunner has shown, that provision was
made for a revocation under certain circumstances. No special
services seem to have been attached to the benefice, whether
granted by the king or by some other person, but, in the second
half of the 9th century at least, the possession of the benefice
is found as the characteristic of the military class and the form
of their pay. This we find clearly set forth in the treatise
<i>de ecclesiis et capellis</i> of Hincmar of Reims. The <i>beneficium</i>, in
obedience to a natural law, soon tended to crystallize into a
perpetual and hereditary right. Another institution akin to the
<i>beneficium</i> was the <i>senioratus</i>; by the <i>commendatio</i>, a form of
solemn contract, probably of Germanic origin, and chiefly
characterized by the placing of the hands between those of the
lord, a man swore absolute fidelity to another man, who became
his <i>senior</i>. It became the generally received idea (as expressed
in the capitularies) that it was natural and normal for every
free man to have a <i>senior</i>. At the same time a benefice was
never granted unless accompanied by the <i>commendatio</i> of the
beneficiary to the grantor. As the most important <i>seniores</i> were
thus bound to the king and received from him their benefices,
he expected through them to command their men; but in reality
the king disappeared little by little in the <i>senior</i>. The king
granted as benefices not only lands, but public functions, such
as those of count or <i>dux</i>, which thus became possessions, held, first
for life, and later as hereditary properties. The Capitulary of
Kiersy-sur-Oise (877), which was formerly considered to have
made fiefs legally and generally hereditary, only proves that it
was already the custom for benefices of this kind, <i>honores</i>, to
pass from the father to one of the sons.</p>

<p>Charlemagne, while sanctioning these institutions, tried to
arrest the political decomposition. He reorganized the administration
of justice, fixing the respective jurisdictions of the
count and the <i>centenarius</i>, substituting for the <i>rachimburgii</i>
<span class="sidenote">Reforms of Charlemagne.</span>
permanent <i>scabini</i>, chosen by the count in the
presence of the people, and defining the relations of
the count, as the representative of the central authority, with
the <i>advocati</i> or <i>judices</i> of <i>immunitates</i> and <i>potestates</i>. He reorganized
the army, determining the obligations and the military
outfit of free men according to their means. Finally, he established
those regular inspections by the <i>missi dominici</i> which are
the subject of so many of his capitularies. From the <i>De ordine
palatii</i> of Hincmar of Reims, who follows the account of a contemporary
of the great emperor, we learn that he also regularly
established two general assemblies, <i>conventus</i> or <i>placita</i>, in the
year, one in the autumn, the other in the spring, which were
attended by the chief officials, lay and ecclesiastical. It was
here that the capitularies (<i>q.v.</i>) and all important measures were
first drawn up and then promulgated. The revenues of the
Carolingian monarch (which are no longer <span class="correction" title="amended from indentical">identical</span> with the
finances of the state) consisted chiefly in the produce of the
royal lands (<i>villae</i>), which the king and his suite often came and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page909" id="page909"></a>909</span>
consumed on the spot; and it is known how carefully Charlemagne
regulated the administration of the <i>villae</i>. There were
also the free gifts which the great men were bound, according
<span class="sidenote">Carolingian fiscal system.</span>
to custom, to bring to the <i>conventus</i>, the contributions
of this character from the monasteries practically
amounting to a tax; the regular personal or territorial
dues into which the old taxes had resolved themselves;
the profits arising from the courts (the royal <i>bannus</i>, and the
<i>fredum</i>, or part of the compensation-money which went to the
king); finally, numberless requisitions in kind, a usage which had
without doubt existed continuously since Roman times. The
Church was loaded with honours and had added a fresh prerogative
to her former privileges, namely, the right of levying a
real tax in kind, the <i>tithe</i>. Since the 3rd century she had tried to
exact the payment of tithes from the faithful, interpreting as
applicable to the Christian clergy the texts in the Old Testament
bearing on the Levites; Gallican councils had repeatedly
proclaimed it as an obligation, though, it appears, with little
success. But from the reign of Pippin the Short onwards the
civil law recognized and sanctioned this obligation, and the
capitularies of Charlemagne and Louis the Debonnaire contain
numerous provisions dealing with it. Ecclesiastical jurisdiction
<span class="sidenote">The Church under Charlemagne.</span>
extended farther and farther, but Charlemagne, the
protector of the papacy, maintained firmly his authority
over the Church. He nominated its dignitaries, both
bishops and abbots, who were true ecclesiastical
officials, parallel with the lay officials. In each <i>pagus</i>,
bishop and count owed each other mutual support, and the missi
on the same circuit were ordinarily a count and a bishop. In
the first collection of capitularies, that of Ansegisus, two books
out of four are devoted to ecclesiastical capitularies.</p>

<p>What, then, was the private and criminal law of this Frankish
monarchy which had come to embrace so many different races?
The men of Roman descent continued under the Roman
law, and the conquerors could not hope to impose their
<span class="sidenote">The law under the Frank monarchy.</span>
customs upon them. The authorized expression of
the Roman law was henceforth to be found in the <i>Lex
romana Wisigothorum</i> or <i>Breviarium Alarici</i>, drawn up by order
of Alaric II. in 506. It is an abridgment of the codes, of that
of Theodosius especially, and of certain of the writings of the
jurists included under the Law of Citations. As to the barbarians,
they had hitherto had nothing but customs, and these customs,
of which the type nearest to the original is to be found in the oldest
text of the <i>Lex Salica</i>, were nothing more than a series of tariffs
of compensations, that is to say, sums of money due to the injured
party or his family in case of crimes committed against individuals,
for which crimes these compensations were the only penalty.
They also introduced a barbarous system of trial, that by compurgation,
<i>i.e.</i> exculpation by the oath of the defendant supported
by a certain number of <i>cojurantes</i>, and that by ordeal, later called
<i>judicium Dei</i>. In each new kingdom the barbarians naturally
kept their own laws, and when these men of different races all
became subject to the Frankish monarchy, there evolved itself
a system (called the <i>personnalité des lois</i>) by which every subject
had, in principle, the right to be tried by the law of the race to
which he belonged by birth (or sometimes for some other reason,
such as emancipation or marriage). When the two adversaries
were of different race, it was the law of the defendant which had
to be applied. The customs of the barbarians had been drawn
up in Latin. Sometimes, as in the case of the first text of the
Salic law, the system on which they were compiled is not exactly
known; but it was generally done under the royal authority.
At this period only these written documents bear the name of
&ldquo;law&rdquo; (<i>leges romanorum</i>; <i>leges barbarorum</i>), and at least the
tacit consent of the people seems to have been required for these
collections of laws, in accordance with an axiom laid down in a
later capitulary; <i>lex fit consensu populi et constitutione regis</i>.
It is noteworthy, too, that in the process of being drawn up in
Latin, most of the <i>leges barbarorum</i> were very much Romanized.</p>

<p>In the midst of this diversity, a certain number of causes
tended to produce a partial unity. The capitularies, which had
in themselves the force of law, when there was no question of
modifying the <i>leges</i>, constituted a legislation which was the same
for all; often they inflicted corporal punishment for grave
offences, which applied to all subjects without distinction. Usage
and individual convenience led to the same result. The Gallo-Romans,
and even the Church itself, to a certain extent, adopted
the methods of trial introduced by the Germans, as was likely
in a country relapsing into barbarism. On the other hand,
written acts became prevalent among the barbarians, and at
the same time they assimilated a certain amount of Roman law;
for these acts continued to be drawn up in Latin, after Roman
models, which were in most cases simply misinterpreted owing
to the general ignorance. The type is preserved for us in those
collections of <i>Formulae</i>, of which complete and scientific editions
have been published by Eugène de Rozière and Carl Zeumer.
During this period, too, the Gallican Church adopted the collection
of councils and decretals, called later the <i>Codex canonum
ecclesiae Gallicanae</i>, which she continued to preserve. This
collection was that of Dionysius Exiguus, which was sent to
Charlemagne in 774 by Pope Adrian I. But in the course of
the 9th century apocryphal collections were also formed in the
Gallican Church: the False Capitularies of Benedictus Levita,
and the False Decretals of Isidorus Mercator (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Decretals</a></span>).</p>

<p>All the subjects of the Frankish monarchy were not of equal
status. There was, strictly speaking, no nobility, both the
Roman and the Germanic nobility having died out; but slavery
continued to exist. The Church, however, was preparing the
transformation of the slave into the serf, by giving force and
validity to their marriages, in cases, at least, when the master
had approved of them, and by forbidding the latter unjustly
to seize the slave&rsquo;s <i>peculium</i>. But between the free man (<i>ingenuus</i>)
and the slave lay a number of persons of intermediate status;
they possessed legal personality but were subject to incapacities
of various kinds, and had to perform various duties towards
other men. There was, to begin with, the Roman colonist
(<i>colonus</i>), a class as to the origin of which there is still a controversy,
and of which there is no clear mention in the laws before
the 4th century; they and their children after them were
attached perpetually to a certain piece of land, which they were
allowed to cultivate on payment of a rent. There were, further,
the <i>liti</i> (<i>litus</i> or <i>lidus</i>), a similar class of Germanic origin; also
the greater number of the freedmen or descendants of freedmen.
Many free men who had fled to the great landowners for protection
took, by arrangement or by custom, a similar position.
Under the Merovingian régime, and especially under the Carolingians,
the occupation of the land tended to assume the character
of tenure; but free ownership of land continued to exist under
the name of <i>alod</i> (<i>alodis</i>), and there is even evidence for the
existence of this in the form of small properties, held by free
men; the capitularies contain numerous complaints and threats
against the counts, who endeavoured by the abuse of their
power to obtain the surrender of these properties.</p>

<p><i>Period of Anarchy and the Rise of Feudalism.</i>&mdash;The 10th and
11th centuries were a period of profound anarchy, during which
feudalism was free to develop itself and to take definitive
shape. At that time the French people may be
<span class="sidenote">Anarchy and feudal origins.</span>
said to have lived without laws, without even fixed
customs and without government. The legislative
power was no longer exercised, for the last Carolingian capitularies
date from the year 884, and the first laws of the Capetian kings
(if they may be called laws) do not appear till during the 12th
century. During this period the old capitularies and <i>leges</i> fell
into disuse and in their place territorial customs tended to grow
up, their main constituents being furnished by the law of former
times, but which were at the outset ill-defined and strictly
local. As to the government, if the part played by the Church
be excepted, we shall see that it could be nothing but the application
of brute force. In this anarchy, as always happens under
similar conditions, men drew together and formed themselves
into groups for mutual defence. A nucleus was formed which
was to become the new social unit, that is to say, the feudal
group. Of this the centre was a chief, around whom gathered
men capable of bearing arms, who commended themselves to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page910" id="page910"></a>910</span>
him according to the old form of vassalage, <i>per manus</i>. They
owed him fidelity and assistance, the support of their arms but
not of their purse, save in quite exceptional cases; while he
owed them protection. Some of them lived in his castle or
fortified house, receiving their equipment only and eating at his
table. Others received lands from him, which were, or later
became, fiefs, on which they lived <i>casati</i>. The name fief, <i>feudum</i>,
does not appear, however, till towards the end of this period;
these lands are frequently called <i>beneficia</i> as before; the term
most in use at first, in many parts, is <i>casamentum</i>. The fief,
moreover, was generally held for life and did not become generally
hereditary till the second half of the 11th century. The lands
kept by the chief and those which he granted to his men were
for the most part rented from him, or from them, for a certain
amount in money or in kind. All these conditions had already
existed previously in much the same form; but the new development
is that the chief was no longer, as before, merely an intermediary
between his men and the royal power. The group
had become in effect independent, so organized as to be socially
and politically self-sufficient. It constituted a small army,
led, naturally, by the chief, and composed of his feudatories,
supplemented in case of need by the <i>rustici</i>. It also formed an
assembly in which common interests were discussed, the lord,
according to custom, being bound to consult his feudatories
and they to advise him to the best of their power. It also
formed a court of justice, in which the feudatories gave judgment
under the presidency of their lord; and all of them claimed
to be subject only to the jurisdiction of this tribunal composed
of their peers. Generally they also judged the villeins (<i>villani</i>)
and the serfs dependent on the group, except in cases where
the latter obtained as a favour judges of their own status, which
was, however, at that time a very rare occurrence.</p>

<p>Under these conditions a nobility was formed, those men
becoming nobles who were able to devote themselves to the
profession of arms and were either chiefs or soldiers in one of the
groups which have just been described. The term designating
a noble, <i>miles</i>, corresponds also to that of knight (Fr. <i>chevalier</i>,
Low Lat. <i>caballerius</i>), for the reason that chivalry, of which the
origins are uncertain, represents essentially the technical skill
and professional duties of this military class. Every noble was
destined on coming of age to become a knight, and the knight
equally as a matter of course received a fief, if he had not one
already by hereditary title. This nobility, moreover, was not
a caste but could be indefinitely recruited by the granting of
fiefs and admission to knighthood (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Knighthood and
Chivalry</a></span>).</p>

<p>The state of anarchy was by now so far advanced that war
became an individual right, and the custom of private war arose.
Every man had in principle the right of making war
to defend his rights or to avenge his wrongs. Later
<span class="sidenote">Private war.</span>
on, doubtless, in the 13th century, this was a privilege
of the noble (<i>gentilhomme</i>); but the texts defining the limits
which the Church endeavoured to set to this abuse, namely, the
Peace of God and the Truce of God, show that this was at the
outset a power possessed by men of all classes. Even a man
who had appeared in a court of law and received judgment
had the choice of refusing to accept the judgment and of
making war instead. Justice, moreover, with its frequent
employment of trial by combat, did not essentially differ from
private war.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to go further and to affirm, with certain
historians of our time, for example Guilhermoz and Sée, that
the only free men at that time, besides the clergy, were the nobles,
all the rest being serfs. There are many indications which lead
us to assume, not only in the towns but even in the country
districts, the existence of a class of men of free status who were
not <i>milites</i>, the class later known in the 13th century as <i>vilains</i>,
<i>hommes de poeste</i>, and, later, <i>roturiers</i>. The fact more probably
was that only the nobles and ecclesiastics were exempt from the
exactions of the feudal lords; while from all the others the
seigneurs could at pleasure levy the <i>taille</i> (a direct and arbitrary
tax), and those innumerable rights then called <i>consuetudines</i>.
Free ownership, the <i>allodium</i>, even under the form of small
freeholds, still existed by way of exception in many parts.</p>

<p>Had, then, the main public authority disappeared? This is
practically the contention of certain writers, who, like M. Sée,
maintain that real property, the possession of a domain, conferred
on the big landed proprietor all rights of taxation, command and
coercion over the inhabitants of his domain, who, according to
this view, were always serfs. But this is an exaggeration of
the thesis upheld by old French authors, who saw in feudalism,
though in a different sense, a confusion of property with
sovereignty. It appears that in this state of political disintegration
each part of the country which had a homogeneous character
tended to form itself into a higher unit. In this unit there arose
a powerful lord, generally a duke, a count, or a viscount, who
sometimes came to be called the <i>capitalis dominus</i>. He was
either a former official of the monarchy, whose function had
become hereditary, or a usurper who had formed himself on this
model. He laid claim to an authority other than that conferred
by the possession of real property. He still claimed to exercise
over the whole of his former district certain rights, which we see
him sometimes surrendering for the benefit of churches or
monasteries. His court of justice was held in the highest honour,
and to it were referred the most important affairs. But in this
district there were generally a number of more or less powerful
lords, who as a rule had as yet no particular feudal title and are
often given the name of <i>principes</i>. Often, but not always, they
had commended themselves to this duke or count by doing
homage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the royal power continued to exist, being
recognized by a considerable part of old Gaul, the <i>regnum
Francorum</i>. But under the last of the Carolingians it
had in fact become elective, as is shown by the elections
<span class="sidenote">The royal power.</span>
of Odo and Robert before that of Hugh Capet. The
electors were the chief lords and prelates of the <i>regnum Francorum</i>.
But following a clever policy, each king during his
lifetime took as partner of his kingdom his eldest son and consecrated
and crowned him in advance, so that the first of the
Capetians revived the principle of heredity in favour of the
eldest son, while establishing the hereditary indivisibility of
the kingdom. This custom was recognized at the accession of
Louis the Fat, but the authority of the king was very weak,
being merely a vague allegiance. His only real authority lay
where his own possessions were, or where there had not arisen
a duke, a count, or lord of equal rank with them. He maintained,
however, a general right of administering justice, a <i>curia</i>, the
jurisdiction of which seems to have been universal. It is true
that the parties in a suit had to submit themselves to it voluntarily,
and could accept or reject the judgment given, but this was at
that time the general rule. The king dispensed justice surrounded
by the officers of his household (<i>domestici</i>), who thus formed his
council; but these were not the only ones to assist him, whether
in court or council. Periodically, at the great yearly festivals,
he called together the chief lords and prelates of his kingdom,
thus carrying on the tradition of the Carolingian <i>placita</i> or
<i>conventus</i>; but little by little, with the appropriation of the
<i>honores</i>, the character of the gathering changed; it was no
longer an assembly of officials but of independent lords. This
was now called the <i>curia regis</i>.</p>

<p>While the power of the State was almost disappearing, that
of the Church, apart from the particular acts of violence of
which she was often the victim, continued to grow.
Her jurisdiction gained ground, since her procedure
<span class="sidenote">The Church.</span>
was reasonable and comparatively scientific (except
that she admitted to a certain extent compurgation by oath
and the <i>judicia Dei</i>, with the exception of trial by combat).
Not only was the privilege of clergy, by which accused clerks
were brought under her jurisdiction, almost absolute, but she
had cognizance of a number of causes in which laymen only were
concerned, marriage and everything nearly or remotely affecting
it, wills, crimes and offences against religion; and even contracts,
when the two parties wished it or when the agreement was made
on oath, came within her competence. Such, then, were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page911" id="page911"></a>911</span>
ecclesiastical or Christian courts (<i>cours d&rsquo;église, course de chrétienté</i>).
The Church, moreover, remained in close connexion with the
crown, the king preserving a quasi-ecclesiastical character,
while the royal prerogatives with regard to the election of bishops
were maintained more successfully than the rights of the crown,
though in many of the great fiefs they none the less passed to
the count or the duke. It was at this time too that the Church
tried to break the last ties which still kept her more or less
dependent on the civil power; this was the true import of the
Investiture Contest (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Investiture</a></span>, and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Church History</a></span>),
though this was not very acute in France.</p>

<p>The period of the true feudal monarchy is embraced by the 12th
and 13th centuries, that is to say, it was at this time that the
crown again assumed real strength and authority;
<span class="sidenote">The feudal monarchy.</span>
but so far it had no organs and instruments save those
which were furnished by feudalism, now organized
under a regular hierarchy, of which the king was the
head, the &ldquo;sovereign enfeoffer of the kingdom&rdquo; (<i>souverain
fieffeux du royaume</i>), as he came later on to be called. This new
position of affairs was the result of three great factors: the
revival of Roman Law, the final organization of feudalism
and the rise of the privileged towns. The revival of Roman
law began in France and Italy in the second half
<span class="sidenote">Roman law.</span>
of the 11th century, developing with extraordinary
brilliance in the latter country at the university of
Bologna, which was destined for a long time to dominate Europe.
Roman law spread rapidly in the French schools and universities,
except that of Paris, which was closed to it by the papacy; and
the influence of this study was so great that it transformed
society. On the one hand it contributed largely to the reconstitution
of the royal power, modelling the rights of the king on
those of the Roman emperor. On the other hand it wrought a
no less profound change in private law. From this time dates
the division of old France into the <i>Pays de droit écrit</i>, in which
Roman law, under the form in which it was codified by Justinian,
was received as the ordinary law; and the <i>Pays de coutume</i>,
<span class="sidenote">The customs.</span>
where it played only a secondary part, being
generally valid only as <i>ratio scripta</i> and not as <i>lex
scripta</i>. In this period the customs also took definitive form,
and over and above the local customs properly so called there
were formed customs known as <i>general</i>, which held good through
a whole province or <i>bailliage</i>, and were based on the jurisprudence
of the higher jurisdictions.</p>

<p>The final organization of feudalism resulted from the struggle
for organization which was proceeding in each district where
the more powerful lords compelled the others to do
them homage and become their vassals; the <i>capitalis dominus</i>
<span class="sidenote">Final organization of feudalism.</span>
had beneath him a whole hierarchy, and was
himself a part of the feudal system of France (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Feudalism</a></span>). Doubtless in the case of lords like the dukes of
Brittany and Burgundy, the king could not actually demand
the strict fulfilment of the feudal obligations; but the principle
was established. The question now arises, did free and absolute
property, the <i>allodium</i>, entirely disappear in this process, and
were all lands held as tenures? It continued to exist, by way
of exception, in most districts, unchanged save in the burden
of proof of ownership, with which, according to the customs,
sometimes the lord and sometimes the holder of the land was held
charged. In one respect, however, namely in the
<span class="sidenote">Feudal character of justice.</span>
administration of justice, the feudal hierarchy had
absolute sway. Towards the end of the 13th century
Beaumanoir clearly laid down this principle: &ldquo;All
secular jurisdiction in France is held from the king as a fief or
an <i>arrière-fief</i>.&rdquo; Henceforth it could also be said that &ldquo;All
justice emanates from the king.&rdquo; The law concerning fiefs
became settled also from another point of view, the fief becoming
patrimonial; that is to say, not only hereditary, but freely
alienable by the vassal, subject in both cases to certain rights of
transfer due to the lord, which were at first fixed by agreement
and later by custom. The most salient features of feudal
succession were the right of primogeniture and the <span class="correction" title="amended from perference">preference</span>
given to heirs-male; but from the 13th century onwards the
right of primogeniture, which had at first involved the total
exclusion of the younger members of a family, tended to be
modified, except in the case of the chief lords, the eldest son
obtaining the preponderant share or <i>préciput</i>. Non-noble
(<i>roturier</i>) tenancies also became patrimonial in similar circumstances,
except that in their case there was no right of primogeniture
nor any privilege of males. The tenure of serfs did not
become alienable, and only became hereditary by certain
devices.</p>

<p>Feudal society next saw the rise of a new element within it:
the privileged towns. At this time many towns acquired
privileges, the movement beginning towards the end
of the 11th century; they were sanctioned by a formal
<span class="sidenote">Rise of the privileged towns.</span>
concession from the lord to whom the town was subject,
the concession being embodied in a charter or in
a record of customs (<i>coutume</i>). Some towns won for themselves
true political rights, for instance the right of self-administration,
rights of justice over the inhabitants, the right of not being
taxed except by their own consent, of maintaining an armed
force, and of controlling it themselves. Others only obtained
civil rights, <i>e.g.</i> guarantees against the arbitrary rights of justice
and taxation of the lord or his provost. The chief forms of
municipal organization at this time were the <i>commune jurée</i> of
the north and east, and the <i>consulat</i>, which came from Italy and
penetrated as far as Auvergne and Limousin. The towns with
important privileges formed in feudal society as it were a new
class of lordships; but their lords, that is to say their burgesses,
were inspired by quite a new spirit. The crown courted their
support, taking them under its protection, and championing
the causes in which they were interested (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Commune</a></span>). Finally,
it is in this period, under Philip Augustus, that the great fiefs
began to be effectually reannexed to the crown, a process which,
continued by the kings up to the end of the <i>ancien régime</i>, refounded
for their profit the territorial sovereignty of France.</p>

<p>The crown maintained the machinery of feudalism, the chief
central instruments of which were the great officers of the crown,
the seneschal, butler, constable and chancellor, who
were to become irremovable officials, those at least
<span class="sidenote">Great officers of the crown and peers of France.</span>
who survived. But this period saw the rise of a
special college of dignitaries, that of the Twelve Peers
of France, consisting of six laymen and six ecclesiastics,
which took definitive shape at the beginning of the
13th century. We cannot yet discern with any certainty by
what process it was formed, why those six prelates and those six
great feudatories in particular were selected rather than others
equally eligible. But there is no doubt that we have here a
result of that process of feudal organization mentioned above;
the formation of a similar assembly of twelve peers occurs also
in a certain number of the great fiefs. Besides the part which
they played at the consecration of kings, the peers of France
formed a court in which they judged one another under the
presidency of the king, their overlord, according to feudal custom.
But the <i>cour des pairs</i> in this sense was not separate from the
<i>curia regis</i>, and later from the parlement of Paris, of which the
peers of France were by right members. From this time, too,
dates another important institution, that of the <i>maîtres des
requêtes</i>.</p>

<p>The legislative power of the crown again began to be exercised
during the 12th century, and in the 13th century had full authority
over all the territories subject to the crown. Beaumanoir
has a very interesting theory on this subject.
<span class="sidenote">Growth of the royal power.</span>
The right of war tends to regain its natural equilibrium,
the royal power following the Church in the endeavour
to check private wars. Hence arose the <i>quarantaine le roi</i>,
due to Philip Augustus or Saint Louis, by which those relatives
of the parties to a quarrel who had not been present at the quarrel
were rendered immune from attack for forty days after it;
and above all the <i>assurements</i> imposed by the king or lord;
on these points too Beaumanoir has an interesting theory.
The rule was, moreover, already in force by which private wars
had to cease during the time that the king was engaged in a
foreign war. But the most appreciable progress took place in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page912" id="page912"></a>912</span>
administrative and judicial institutions. Under Philip Augustus
arose the royal <i>baillis</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bailiff</a></span>: section <i>Bailli</i>), and seneschals
(<i>q.v.</i>), who were the representatives of the king in the provinces,
and superior judges. At the same time the form of the feudal
courts tended to change, as they began more and more to be
influenced by the Romano-canonical law. Saint Louis had
striven to abolish trial by combat, and the Church had condemned
other forms of ordeal, the <i>purgatio vulgaris</i>. In most parts of
the country the feudal lords began to give place in the courts of
law to the provosts (<i>prévôts</i>) and <i>baillis</i> of the lords or of the
crown, who were the judges, having as their councillors the
<i>avocats</i> (advocates) and <i>procureurs</i> (procurators) of the assize.
The feudal courts, which were founded solely on the relations of
homage and tenure, before which the vassals and tenants as
such appeared, disappeared in part from the 13th century on.
Of the seigniorial jurisdictions there soon remained only the
<i>hautes</i> or <i>basses justices</i> (in the 14th century arose an intermediate
grade, the <i>moyenne justice</i>), all of which were considered to be
concessions of the royal power, and so delegations of the public
authority. As a result of the application of Roman and canon
law, there arose the <i>appeal</i> strictly so called, both in the class of
royal and of seigniorial jurisdictions, the case in the latter instance
going finally before a royal court, from which henceforth there
was no appeal. In the 13th century too appeared the theory
of crown cases (<i>cas royaux</i>), cases which the lords became incompetent
to try and which were reserved for the royal court.
Finally, the <i>curia regis</i> was gradually transformed into a regular
court of justice, the <i>Parlement</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), as it was already called
in the second half of the 13th century. At this time the king
no longer appeared in it regularly, and before each session (for
it was not yet a permanent body) a list of properly qualified men
was drawn up in advance to form the parlement, only those whose
names were on the list being capable of sitting in it. Its main
function had come to be that of a final court of appeal. At the
various sessions, which were regularly held at Paris, appeared
the <i>baillis</i> and seneschals, who were called upon to answer for
the cases they had judged and also for their administration.
The accounts were received by members of the parlement at
the Temple, and this was the origin of the Cour or Chambre des
Comptes.</p>

<p>At the end of this period the nobility became an exclusive
class. It became an established rule that a man had to be noble
in order to be made a knight, and even in order to
acquire a fief; but in this latter respect the king
<span class="sidenote">Nobles, commons and the Church in the 13th century.</span>
made exceptions in the case of <i>roturiers</i>, who were
licensed to take up fiefs, subject to a payment known
as the <i>droits de franc-fief</i>. The <i>roturiers</i>, or villeins
who were not in a state of thraldom, were already a
numerous class not only in the towns but in the country.
The Church maintained her privileges; a few attempts only
were made to restrain the abuse, not the extent, of her jurisdiction.
This jurisdiction was, during the 12th century, to a certain
extent regularized, the bishop nominating a special functionary
to hold his court; this was the <i>officialis</i> (Fr. <i>official</i>), whence the
name of <i>officialité</i> later applied in France to the ecclesiastical
jurisdictions. On one point, however, her former rights were
diminished. She preserved the right of freely acquiring personal
and real property, but though she could still acquire feudal
tenures she could not keep them; the customs decided that she
must <i>vider les mains</i>, that is, alienate the property again within
a year and a day. The reason for this new rule was that the
Church, the ecclesiastical establishment, is a proprietor who
does not die and in principle does not surrender her property;
consequently, the lords had no longer the right of exacting the
transfer duties on those tenures which she acquired. It was
possible, however, to compromise and allow the Church to keep
the tenure on condition of the consent not only of the lord
directly concerned, but of all the higher lords up to the <i>capitalis
dominus</i>; it goes without saying that this concession was only
obtained by the payment of pecuniary compensations, the chief
of which was the <i>droit d&rsquo;amortissement</i>, paid to these different
lords. In this period the form of the episcopal elections underwent
a change, the electoral college coming to consist only of the
canons composing the chapter of the cathedral church. But
except for the official candidatures, which were abused by the
kings and great lords, the elections were regular; the Pragmatic
Sanction, attributed to Saint Louis, which implies the contrary,
is nowadays considered apocryphal by the best critics.</p>

<p>Finally, it must be added that during the 13th century criminal
law was profoundly modified. Under the influence of Roman
law a system of arbitrary penalties replaced those
laid down by the customs, which had usually been
<span class="sidenote">Changes in criminal law.</span>
fixed and cruel. The criminal procedure of the feudal
courts had been based on the right of accusation
vested only in the person wronged and his relations; for this
was substituted the inquisitorial procedure (<i>processus per
inquisitionem</i>), which had developed in the canon law at the very
end of the 12th century, and was to become the <i>procédure à
l&rsquo;extraordinaire</i> of the <i>ancien régime</i>, which was conducted in
secret and without free defence and debate. Of this procedure
torture came to be an ordinary and regular part.</p>

<p>The customs, which at that time contained almost the whole
of the law for a great part of France, were not fixed by being
written down. In that part of France which was
subject to customary law (<i>la France coutumière</i>) they
<span class="sidenote">The customs.</span>
were defined when necessary by the verdict of a jury
of practitioners in what was called the <i>enquête par turbes</i>; some
of them, however, were, in part at least, authentically recorded
in seigniorial charters, <i>chartes de ville</i> or <i>chartes de coutume</i>.
Their rules were also recorded by experts in private works or
collections called <i>livres coutumiers</i>, or simply <i>coutumiers</i>
(customaries). The most notable of these are <i>Les Coutumes
de Beauvoisis</i> of Philippe de Beaumanoir, which Montesquieu
justly quotes as throwing light on those times; also the <i>Très
ancienne coutume de Normandie</i> and the <i>Grand Coutumier de
Normandie</i>; the <i>Conseil à un ami of Pierre des Fontaines</i>, the
<i>Établissements de Saint Louis</i>; the <i>Livre de jostice et de plet</i>.
At the same time the clerks of important judges began to collect
in registers notable decisions; it is in this way that we have
preserved to us the old decisions of the exchequer of Normandy,
and the <i>Olim</i> registers of the parlement of Paris.</p>

<p><i>The Limited Monarchy</i>.&mdash;The 14th and 15th centuries were
the age of the limited monarchy. Feudal institutions kept
their political importance; but side by side with them arose
others of which the object was the direct exercise of the royal
authority; others also arose from the very heart of feudalism,
but at the same time transformed its laws in order to adapt them
to the new needs of the crown. In this period certain rules for
the succession to the throne were fixed by precedents: the
exclusion of women and of male descendants in the female
line, and the principle that a king could not by an act of will
change the succession of the crown. The old <i>curia regis</i> disappeared
and was replaced by the parlement as to its judicial
functions, while to fulfil its deliberative functions there was
formed a new body, the royal council (<i>conseil du roi</i>), an administrative
and governing council, which was in no way of a
feudal character. The number of its members was at first small,
but they tended to increase; soon the brevet of <i>conseiller du
roi en ses conseils</i> was given to numerous representatives of the
clergy and nobility, the great officers of the crown becoming
members by right. Side by side with these officials, whose power
was then at its height, there were gradually evolved more
subservient ministers who could be dispensed with at will;
the <i>secrétaires des commandements du roi</i> of the 15th century,
who in the 16th century developed into the <i>secrétaires d&rsquo;état</i>,
and were themselves descended from the <i>clercs du secret</i> and
<i>secrétaires des finances</i> of the 14th century. The College of the
Twelve Peers of France had not its full numbers at the end of
the 13th century; the six ecclesiastical peerages existed and
continued to exist to the end, together with the archbishopric
and bishoprics to which they were attached, not being suppressed;
but several of the great fiefs to which six lay peerages had been
attached had been annexed to the crown. To fill these vacancies,
Philip the Fair raised the duchies of Brittany and Anjou and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page913" id="page913"></a>913</span>
the countship of Artois to the rank of peerages of France. This
really amounted to changing the nature of the institution;
for the new peers held their rank merely at the king&rsquo;s will,
though the rank continued to belong to a great barony and to
be handed down with it. Before long peers began to be created
when there were no gaps in the ranks of the College, and there
was a constant increase in the numbers of the lay peers.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 14th century appeared the states
general (<i>états généraux</i>), which were often convoked, though not
at fixed intervals, throughout the whole of the 14th
century and the greater part of the 15th. Their
<span class="sidenote">States general and provincial estates.</span>
power reached its height at a critical moment of the
Hundred Years&rsquo; War during the reign of King John.
At the same time there arose side by side with them,
and from the same causes, the provincial estates, which were
in miniature for each province what the states general were for
the whole kingdom. Of these provincial assemblies some were
founded in one or other of the great fiefs, being convoked by the
duke or count under the pressure of the same needs which led
the king to convoke the states general; others, in provinces
which had already been annexed to the crown, probably had
their origin in the councils summoned by the <i>bailli</i> or seneschal to
aid him in his administration. Later it became a privilege for
a province to have its own assembly; those which did so were
never of right subject to the royal <i>taille</i>, and kept, at least
formally, the right of sanctioning, by means of the assembly, the
subsidies which took its place. Hence it became the endeavour
of the crown to suppress these provincial assemblies, which in
the 14th century were to be found everywhere; from the outset
of the 15th century they began to disappear in central France.</p>

<p>The most characteristic feature of this period was the institution
of universal taxation by the crown. So far the king&rsquo;s sole
revenues were those which he exacted, in his capacity
of feudal lord, wherever another lord did not intervene
<span class="sidenote">Royal taxation.</span>
between him and the inhabitants, in addition to the income
arising from certain crown rights which he had preserved or
regained. But these revenues, known later as the income of the
royal domain and later still as the <i>finances ordinaires</i>, became
insufficient in proportion as the royal power increased; it
became a necessity for the monarch to be able to levy imposts
throughout the whole extent of the provinces annexed to the
crown, even upon the subjects of the different lords. This he
could only do by means of the co-operation of those lords, lay and
ecclesiastical, who alone had the right of taxing their subjects;
the co-operation of the privileged towns, which had the right to
tax themselves, was also necessary. It was in order to obtain
this consent that the states general, in most cases, and the provincial
assemblies, in all cases, were convoked. In some cases,
however, the king adopted different methods; for instance,
he sometimes utilized the principle of the feudal aids. In cases
where his vassals owed him, as overlord, a pecuniary aid, he
substituted for the sum paid directly by his vassals a tax levied
by his own authority on their subjects. It is in this way that for
thirty years the necessary sums were raised, without any vote
from the states general, to pay the ransom of King John. But
in principle the taxes were in the 14th century sanctioned by
the states general. Whatever form they took, they were given
the generic name of Aids or <i>auxilia</i>, and were considered as
occasional and extraordinary subsidies, the king being obliged
in principle to &ldquo;live of his own&rdquo; (<i>vivre de son domaine</i>). Certain
aids, it is true, tended to become permanent under the reign of
Charles VI.; but the taxes subject to the consent of the states
general were at first the sole resource of Charles VII. In the
second half of his reign the two chief taxes became permanent:
in 1435 that of the aids (a tax on the sale of articles of consumption,
especially on wine), with the formal consent of the
states general, and that of the <i>taille</i> in 1439. In the latter case
the consent of the states general was not given; but only the
nobility protested, for at the same time as the royal <i>taille</i> became
permanent the seigniorial <i>taille</i> was suppressed. These imposts
were increased, on the royal authority, by Louis XI. After his
death the states general, which met at Tours in 1484, endeavoured
to re-establish the periodical vote of the tax, and only granted
it for two years, reducing it to the sum which it had reached
at the death of Charles VII. But the promise that they would
again be convoked before the expiry of two years was not kept.
These imposts and that of the <i>gabelle</i> were henceforth permanent.
Together with the taxes there was evolved the system of their
administration. Their main outlines were laid down by the
states general in the reign of King John, in 1355 and the following
years. For the administration of the subsidies which they
granted, they nominated from among their own numbers
<i>surintendants généraux</i> or <i>généraux des finances</i>, and further,
for each diocese or equivalent district, <i>élus</i>. Both had not only
the active administration but also judicial rights, the latter
constituting courts of the first instance and the former courts of
final appeal. After 1360 the crown again adopted this organization,
which had before been only temporary; but henceforth
<i>généraux</i> and <i>élus</i> were nominated by the king. The <i>élus</i>, or
<i>officiers des élections</i>, only existed in districts which were subject
to the royal <i>taille</i>; hence the division, so important in old France,
into <i>pays d&rsquo;élections</i> and <i>pays d&rsquo;états</i>. The <i>élus</i> kept both
administration and jurisdiction; but in the higher stage a differentiation
was made: the <i>généraux des finances</i>, who numbered
four, kept the administration, while their jurisdiction as a court
of final appeal was handed over to another body, the <i>cour des
aides</i>, which had already been founded at the end of the 14th
century. Besides the four <i>généraux des finances</i>, who administered
the taxation, there were four Treasurers of France (<i>trésoriers
de France</i>), who administered the royal domain; and these eight
officials together formed in the 15th century a kind of ministry
of finance to the monarchy.</p>

<p>The army also was organized. On the one hand, the military
service attached to the fiefs was transformed for the profit
of the king, who alone had the right of making war:
it became the <i>arrière-ban</i>, a term which had formerly
<span class="sidenote">The army.</span>
applied to the <i>levée en masse</i> of all the inhabitants in
times of national danger. Before the 14th century the king
had only had the power of calling upon his own immediate vassals
for service. Henceforth all possessors of fiefs owed him, whether
within the kingdom or on the frontiers, military service without
pay and at their own expense. This was for long an important
resource for the king. But Charles VII. organized an army on
another footing. It comprised the <i>francs-archers</i> furnished by
the parishes, a militia which was only summoned in case of war,
but in time of peace had to practise archery, and companies of
<i>gendarmerie</i> or heavy cavalry, forming a permanent establishment,
which were called <i>compagnies d&rsquo;ordonnance</i>. It was
chiefly to provide for the expense of the first nucleus of a permanent
army that the <i>taille</i> itself had been made permanent.</p>

<p>The new army led to the institution of the governors of provinces,
who were to command the troops quartered there. At
first they were only appointed for the frontiers and fortified
places, but later the kingdom was divided into <i>gouvernements
généraux</i>. There were at first twelve of these, which were called
in the middle of the 16th century the <i>douze anciens gouvernements</i>.
Although, strictly speaking, they had only military powers, the
governors, always chosen from among the great lords, became
in the provinces the direct representatives of the king and caused
the <i>baillis</i> and seneschals to take a secondary place.</p>

<p>The courts of law continued to develop on the lines already
laid down. The parlement, which had come to be a judicial
committee nominated every year, but always consisting
in fact of the same persons, changed in the course of the
<span class="sidenote">The law courts.</span>
14th century into a body of magistrates who were
permanent but as yet subject to removal. During this period
were evolved its organization and definitive features (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Parlement</a></span>).
The provincial parlements had arisen after and in imitation
of that of Paris, and had for the most part taken the place of
some superior jurisdiction which had formerly existed in the same
district when it had been independent (like Provence) or had
formed one of the great fiefs (like Normandy or Burgundy).
It was during this period also that the parlements acquired the
right of opposing the registration, that is to say, the promulgation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page914" id="page914"></a>914</span>
of laws, of revising them, and of making representations (<i>remontrances</i>)
to the king when they refused the registration, giving
the reasons for such refusal. The other royal jurisdictions were
completed (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bailiff</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Châtelet</a></span>). Besides them arose another
of great importance, which was of military origin, but came to
include all citizens under its sway. These were the provosts
of the marshals of France (<i>prévôts des maréchaux de France</i>),
who were officers of the <i>Maréchaussée</i> (the gendarmerie of the
time); they exercised criminal jurisdiction without appeal in
the case of crimes committed by vagabonds and fugitives from
justice, this class being called their <i>gibier</i> (game), and of a number
of crimes of violence, whatever the rank of the offender. Further,
another class of officers was created in connexion with the law
courts: the &ldquo;king&rsquo;s men&rdquo; (<i>gens du roi</i>), the <i>procureurs</i> and
<i>avocats du roi</i>, who were at first simply those lawyers who
represented the king in the law courts, or pleaded for him when
he had some interest to follow up or to defend. Later they became
officers of the crown. In the case of the <i>procureurs du roi</i> this
development took place in the first half of the 14th century.
Their duty was not only to represent the king in the law courts,
whether as plaintiff or defendant, but also to take care that in
each case the law was applied, and to demand its application.
From this time on the <i>procureurs du roi</i> had full control over
matters concerning the public interest, and especially over
public prosecution. In this period, too, appeared what was
afterwards called <i>justice retenue</i>, that is to say, the justice which
the king administered, or was supposed to administer, in person.
It was based on the idea that, since all justice and all judicial
power reside in the king, he could not deprive himself of them
by delegating their exercise to his officers and to the feudal
lords. Consequently he could, if he thought fit, take the place
of the judges and call up a case before his own council. He could
reverse even the decisions of the courts of final appeal, and in
some cases used this means of appealing against the decrees of the
parlements (<i>proposition d&rsquo;erreur, requête civile, pourvoi en révision</i>).
In these cases the king was supposed to judge in person; in
reality they were examined by the <i>maîtres des requêtes</i> and
submitted to the royal council (<i>conseil du roi</i>), at which the king
was always supposed to be present and which had in itself no
power of giving a decision. For this purpose there was soon
formed a special committee of the council, which was called the
<i>conseil privé</i> or <i>de justice</i>. At the end of the 15th century,
Charles VIII., in order to relieve the council of some of its functions,
created a new final court, the <i>grand conseil</i>, to deal with
a number of these cases. But before long it again became the
custom to appeal to the <i>conseil du roi</i>, so that the <i>grand conseil</i>
became almost useless. The king frequently, by means of
<i>lettres de justice</i>, intervened in the procedure of the courts, by
granting <i>bénéfices</i>, by which rules which were too severe were
modified, and faculties or facilities for overcoming difficulties
arising from flaws in contracts or judgments, cases at that time
not covered by the common law. By <i>lettres de grâce</i> he granted
reprieve or pardon in individual cases. The most extreme
form of intervention by the king was made by means of <i>lettres de
cachet</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), which ordered a subject to go without trial into a
state prison or into exile.</p>

<p>The condition of the Church changed greatly during this period.
The jurisdiction of the <i>officialités</i> was very much reduced, even
over the clergy. They ceased to be competent to
judge actions concerning the possession of real property,
<span class="sidenote">The Church.</span>
in which the clergy were defendants. In criminal
law the theory of the <i>cas privilégié</i>, which appears in the 14th
century, enabled the royal judges to take action against and judge
the clergy for all serious crimes, though without the power of
inflicting any penalties but arbitrary fines, the ecclesiastical
judge remaining competent, in accordance with the privileges of
clergy, to try the offender for the same crime as what was
technically called a <i>délit commun</i>. The development of jurisprudence
gradually removed from the <i>officialités</i> causes of a
purely secular character in which laymen only were concerned,
such as wills and contracts; and in matrimonial cases their
jurisdiction was limited to those in which the <i>foedus matrimonii</i>
was in question. For the acquisition of real property by ecclesiastical
establishments the consent of the king to the amortizement
was always necessary, even in the case of allodial lands;
and if it was a case of feudal tenures the king and the direct
overlords alone kept their rights, the intermediate lords being
left out of the question.</p>

<p>As regards the conferring of ecclesiastical benefices, from the
14th century onwards the papacy encroached more and more
upon the rights of the bishops, in whose gift the inferior
benefices generally were, and of the electors, who
<span class="sidenote">Papal encroachments.</span>
usually conferred the superior benefices; at the same
time it exacted from newly appointed incumbents
heavy dues, which were included under the generic name of
annates (<i>q.v.</i>). During the Great Schism of the Western Church,
these abuses became more and more crying, until by a series of
edicts, promulgated with the consent and advice of the parlement
and the clergy, the Gallican Church was restored to the possession
of its former liberties, under the royal authority. Thus France
was ready to accept the decrees of reform issued by the council
of Basel (<i>q.v.</i>), which she did, with a few modifications, in the
Pragmatic Sanction of Charles VII., adopted after a solemn
assembly of the clergy and nobles at Bourges and registered
by the parlement of Paris in 1438. It suppressed the annates
and most of the means by which the popes disposed of the inferior
benefices: the reservations and the <i>gratiae expectativae</i>. For
the choice of bishops and abbots, it restored election by the
chapters and convents. The Pragmatic Sanction, however,
was never recognized by the papacy, nor was it consistently and
strictly applied by the royal power. The transformation of the
civil and criminal law under the influence of Roman and canon
law had become more and more marked. The production of the
<i>coutumiers</i>, or <i>livres de pratiques</i>, also continued. The chief of
them were: in the 14th century, the <i>Stylus Vetus Curiae Parlamenti</i>
of Guillaume de Breuil; the <i>Très ancienne coutume de
Bretagne</i>; the <i>Grand Coutumier de France</i>, or <i>Coutumier de
Charles VI.</i>; the <i>Somme rural</i> of Boutillier; in the 15th century,
for Auvergne, the <i>Practica forensis</i> of Masuer. Charles VII.,
in an article of the Grand Ordonnance of Montil-les-Tours (1453),
ordered the general customs to be officially recorded under the
supervision of the crown. It was an enormous work, which
would almost have transformed them into written laws; but
up to the 16th century little recording was done, the procedure
established by the Ordonnance for the purpose not being very
suitable.</p>

<p><i>The Absolute Monarchy</i>.&mdash;From the 16th century to the
Revolution was the period of the absolute monarchy, but it
can be further divided into two periods: that of the
establishment of this régime, from 1515 to about
<span class="sidenote">Government under the absolute monarchy.</span>
1673; and that of the <i>ancien régime</i> when definitively
established, from 1673 to 1789. The reigns of Francis
I. and Henry II. clearly laid down the principle of the
absolute power of the crown and applied it effectually, as is
plainly seen from the temporary disappearance of the states
general, which were not assembled under these two reigns.
There were merely a few assemblies of notables chosen by the
royal power, the most important of which was that of Cognac,
under Francis I., summoned to advise on the non-fulfilment
of the treaty of Madrid. It is true that in the second half of
the 16th century the states general reappeared. They were
summoned in 1560 at Orleans, then in 1561 at Pontoise, and in
1576 and 1588 at Blois. The League even convoked one, which
was held at Paris in 1593. This represented a crucial and final
struggle. Two points were then at issue: firstly, whether
France was to be Protestant or Catholic; secondly, whether
she was to have a limited or an absolute monarchy. The two
problems were not necessarily bound up with one another. For
if the Protestants desired political liberty, many of the Catholics
wished for it too, as is proved by the writings of the time, and
even by the fact that the League summoned the estates. But
the states general of the 16th century, in spite of their good intentions
and the great talents which were at their service, were
dominated by religious passions, which made them powerless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page915" id="page915"></a>915</span>
for any practical purpose. They only produced a few great
ordinances of reform, which were not well observed. They were,
however, to be called together yet again, as a result of the
disturbances which followed the death of Henry IV.; but their
dissensions and powerlessness were again strikingly exemplified
and they did not reappear until 1789. Other bodies, however,
which the royal power had created, were to carry on the struggle
against it. There were the parlements, the political rivals of
the states general. Thanks to the principle according to which
no law came into effect so long as it had not been registered by
them, they had, as we have seen, won for themselves the right
of a preliminary discussion of those laws which were presented
to them, and of refusing registration, explaining their reasons
to the king by means of the <i>remontrances</i>. The royal power saw
in this merely a concession from itself, a consultative power,
which ought to yield before the royal will, when the latter was
clearly manifested, either by <i>lettres de jussion</i> or by the actual
words and presence of the king, when he came in person to procure
the registration of a law in a so-called <i>lit de justice</i>. But from
the 16th century onwards the members of the parlements
claimed, on the strength of a historical theory, to have inherited
the powers of the ancient assemblies (the Merovingian and
Carolingian <i>placita</i> and the <i>curia regis</i>), powers which they,
moreover, greatly exaggerated. The successful assertion of
this claim would have made them at once independent of and
necessary to the crown. During the minority of kings, they had
possessed, in fact, special opportunities for asserting their pretensions,
particularly when they had been called upon to intervene
in the organization of the regency. It is on this account that at
the beginning of the reign of Louis XIV. the parlement of Paris
wished to take part in the government, and in 1648, in concert
with the other supreme courts of the capital, temporarily imposed
a sort of charter of liberties. But the first Fronde, of which
the parlement was the centre and soul, led to its downfall, which
was completed when later on Louis XIV. became all-powerful.
The ordinance of 1667 on civil procedure, and above all a declaration
of 1673, ordered the parlement to register the laws as
soon as it received them and without any modification. It was
only after this registration that they were allowed to draw up
remonstrances, which were henceforth futile. The nobles, as a
body, had also become politically impotent. They had been
sorely tried by the wars of religion, and Richelieu, in his struggles
against the governors of the provinces, had crushed their chief
leaders. The second Fronde was their last effort (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fronde</a></span>).
At the same time the central government underwent changes.
The great officers of the crown disappeared one by one. The
office of constable of France was suppressed by purchase during
the first half of the 17th century, and of those in the first rank
only the chancellor survived till the Revolution. But though
his title could only be taken from him by condemnation on a
capital charge, the king was able to deprive him of his functions
by taking from him the custody and use of the seal of France,
which were entrusted to a <i>garde des sceaux</i>. Apart from the latter,
the king&rsquo;s real ministers were the secretaries of state, generally
four in number, who were always removable and were not chosen
from among the great nobles. For purposes of internal administration,
the provinces were divided among them, each of them
corresponding by despatches with those which were assigned to
him. Any other business (with the exception of legal affairs,
which belonged to the chancellor, and finance, of which we shall
speak later) was divided among them according to convenience.
At the end of the 16th century, however, were evolved two
regular departments, those of war and foreign affairs. Under
Francis I. and Henry II., the chief administration of finance
underwent a change; for the four <i>généraux des finances</i>, who
had become too powerful, were substituted the <i>intendants des
finances</i>, one of whom soon became a chief minister of finance,
with the title <i>surintendant</i>. The <i>généraux des finances</i>, like the
<i>trésoriers</i> de France, became provincial officials, each at the head
of a <i>généralité</i> (a superior administrative district for purposes
of finance); under Henry II. the two functions were combined
and assigned to the <i>bureaux des finances</i>. The fall of Fouquet
led to the suppression of the office of <i>surintendant</i>; but soon
Colbert again became practically a minister of finance, under the
name of <i>contrôleur général des finances</i>, both title and office
continuing to exist up to the Revolution.</p>

<p>The <i>conseil du roi</i>, the origin of which we have described,
was an important organ of the central government, and for a
long time included among its members a large number of representatives
of the nobility and clergy. Besides the councillors
of state (<i>conseillers d&rsquo;état</i>), its ordinary members, the great officers
of the crown and secretaries of state, princes of the blood and
peers of France were members of it by right. Further, the king
was accustomed to grant the brevet of councillor to a great
number of the nobility and clergy, who could be called upon
to sit in the council and give an opinion on matters of importance.
But in the 17th century the council tended to differentiate its
functions, forming three principal sections, one for political,
one for financial, and the third for legal affairs. Under Louis
XIV. it took a definitely professional, administrative and
technical character. The <i>conseillers à brevet</i> were all suppressed
in 1673, and the peers of France ceased to be members of the
council. The political council, or <i>conseil d&rsquo;en haut</i>, had no <i>ex
officio</i> members, not even the chancellor; the secretary of state
for foreign affairs, however, necessarily had entry to it; it also
included a small number of persons chosen by the king and
bearing the title of ministers of state (<i>ministres d&rsquo;état</i>). The
other important sections of the conseil du roi were the <i>conseil
des finances</i>, organized after the fall of Fouquet, and the <i>conseil
des dépêches</i>, in which sat the four secretaries of state and where
everything concerned with internal administration (except
finance) was dealt with, including the legal business connected
with this administration. As to the government and the preparation
of laws, under Louis XIV. and Louis XV., the <i>conseil du roi</i>
often passed into the background, when, as the saying went,
a minister who was projecting some important measure <i>travaillait
seul avec le roi</i> (worked alone with the king), having from
the outset gained the king&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>The chief authority in the provincial administration belonged
in the 16th century to the governors of the provinces, though,
strictly speaking, the governor had only military
powers in his <i>gouvernement</i>; for, as we have seen, he
<span class="sidenote">Provincial administration.</span>
was the direct representative of the king for general
purposes. But at the end of this century were
created the intendants of the provinces, who, after a period
of conflict with the governors and the parlements, became
absolute masters of the administration in all those provinces
which had no provincial estates, and the instruments of a
complete administrative centralization (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Intendant</a></span>).</p>

<p>The towns having a <i>corps de ville</i>, that is to say, a municipal
organization, preserved in the 16th century a fairly wide
autonomy, and played an important part in the wars
of religion, especially under the League. But under
<span class="sidenote">The towns.</span>
Louis XIV. their independence rapidly declined.
They were placed under the tutelage of the intendants, whose
sanction, or that of the <i>conseil du roi</i>, was necessary for all acts
of any importance. In the closing years of the 17th century,
the municipal officials ceased, even in principle, to be elective.
Their functions ranked as offices which were, like royal offices,
saleable and heritable. The pretext given by the edicts were the
intrigues and dissensions caused by the elections; the real
cause was that the government wanted to sell these offices,
which is proved by the fact that it frequently allowed towns
to redeem them and to re-establish the elections.</p>

<p>The sale of royal offices is one of the characteristic features of
the <i>ancien régime</i>. It had begun early, and, apparently, with
the office of councillor of the parlement of Paris, when
this became permanent, in the second half of the 14th
<span class="sidenote">Sale of offices.</span>
century. It was first practised by magistrates who
wished to dispose of their office in favour of a successor of their
own choice. The <i>resignatio in favorem</i> of ecclesiastical benefices
served as model, and at first care was taken to conceal the
money transaction between the parties. The crown winked
at these resignations in consideration of a payment in money.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page916" id="page916"></a>916</span>
But in the 16th century, under Francis I. at the latest, the crown
itself began officially to sell offices, whether newly created or
vacant by the death of their occupiers, taking a fee from those
upon whom they were conferred. Under Charles IX. the right
of resigning <i>in favorem</i> was recognized by law in the case of
royal officials, in return for a payment to the treasury of a
certain proportion of the price. In the case of judicial offices
there was a struggle for at least two centuries between the system
of sale and another, also imitated from canon law, <i>i.e.</i> the election
or presentation of candidates by the legal corporations. The
ordinances of the second half of the 16th century, granted in
answer to complaints of the states general, restored and confirmed
the latter system, giving a share in the presentation
to the towns or provincial notables and forbidding sales. The
system of sale, however, triumphed in the end, and, in the case
of judges, had, moreover, a favourable result, assuring to them
that irremovability which Louis XI. had promised in vain; for,
under this system, the king could not reasonably dismiss an
official arbitrarily without refunding the fee which he had
paid. On the other hand, it contributed to the development
of the <i>épices</i>, or dues paid by litigants to the judges. The system
of sale, and with it irremovability, was extended to all official
functions, even to financial posts. The process was completed
by the recognition of the rights in the sale of offices as hereditary,
<i>i.e.</i> the right of resigning the office on payment of a fee, either
in favour of a competent descendant or of a third party, passed
to the heirs of an official who had died without having exercised
this right himself. It was established under Henry IV. in 1604
by the system called the <i>Paulette</i>, in return for the payment
by the official of an annual fee (<i>droit annuel</i>) which was definitely
fixed at a hundredth part of the price of the office. Thus these
offices, though the royal nomination was still required as well
as the professional qualifications required by the law, became
heritable property in virtue of the finance attached to them.
This led to the formation of a class of men who, though bound
in many ways to the crown, were actually independent. Hence
the tendency in the 18th century to create new and important
functions under the form, not of offices, but of simple commissions.</p>

<p>In this period of the history of France were evolved and defined
the essential principles of the old public law. There were,
in the first place, the <i>fundamental laws of the realm</i>,
which were true constitutional principles, established
<span class="sidenote">Fundamental laws of France.</span>
for the most part not by law but by custom, and
considered as binding in respect of the king himself;
so that, although he was sovereign, he could neither abrogate,
nor modify, nor violate them. There was, however, some discussion
as to what rules actually came under this category, except in
the case of two series about which there was no doubt. These
were, on the one hand, those which dealt with the succession
to the crown and forbade the king to change its order, and those
which proclaimed the inalienability of the royal domain, against
which no title by prescription was valid. This last principle,
introduced in the 14th century, had been laid down and defined
by the edict of Moulins in 1566; it admitted only two exceptions:
the formation of appanages (<i>q.v.</i>), and selling (<i>engagement</i>), to
meet the necessities of war, with a perpetual option of redeeming
it.</p>

<p>There was in the second place the theory of the rights, franchises
and liberties of the Gallican Church, formed of elements some
of which were of great antiquity, and based on the conditions
which had determined the relations of the Gallican Church
with the crown and papacy during the Great Schism and under
the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, and defined at the end of
the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century. This body of
doctrine was defined by the writings of three men especially,
Guy Coquille, Pierre Pithou and Pierre Dupuy, and was solemnly
confirmed by the declaration of the clergy of France, or <i>Déclaration
des quatres articles</i> of 1682, and by the edict which promulgated
it. Its substance was based chiefly on three principles:
firstly, that the temporal power was absolutely independent of
the spiritual power; secondly, that the pope had authority
over the clergy of France in temporal matters and matters of
discipline only by the consent of the king; thirdly, that the
king had authority over and could legislate for the Gallican
Church in temporal matters and matters of discipline. The old
public law provided a safeguard against the violation of these
rules. This was the process known as the <i>appel comme d&rsquo;abus</i>,
formed of various elements, some of them very ancient, and
definitely established during the 16th century. It was heard
before the parlements, but could, like every other case, be
evoked before the royal council. Its effect was to annul any
act of the ecclesiastical authority due to abuse or contrary to
French law. The clergy were, when necessary, reduced to
obedience by means of arbitrary fines and by the seizure of their
temporalities. The Pragmatic Sanction had been abrogated
and replaced by the Concordat of 1515, concluded between
Francis I. and Leo X., which remained in force until suppressed
by the Constituent Assembly. The Concordat, moreover,
preserved many of the enactments of the Pragmatic Sanction,
notably those which protected the collation of the inferior benefices
from the encroachments of the papacy, and which had introduced
reforms in certain points of discipline. But in the case of the
superior benefices (bishoprics and abbeys) election by the
chapters was suppressed. The king of France nominated the
candidate, to whom the pope gave canonical institution. As a
matter of fact, the pope had no choice; he had to institute the
nominee of the king, unless he could show his unworthiness or
incapacity, as the result of inquiries regularly conducted in
France; for the pope it was, as the ancient French authors
used to say, a case of compulsory collation. The annates were
re-established at the time of the Concordat, but considerably
diminished in comparison with what they had been before the
Pragmatic Sanction. We must add, to complete this account,
that many of the inferior benefices, in France as in the rest of
Christendom, were conferred according to the rules of patronage,
the patron, whether lay or ecclesiastic, presenting a candidate
whom the bishop was bound to appoint, provided he was neither
incapable nor unsuitable. There was some difficulty in getting
the Concordat registered by the parlement of Paris, and the
latter even announced its intention of not taking the Concordat
into account in those cases concerning benefices which might
come before it. The crown found an easy method of making
this opposition ineffectual, namely, to transfer to the Grand
Conseil the decision of cases arising out of the application of the
Concordat.</p>

<p>In the 16th century also, contributions to the public services
drawn from the immense possessions of the clergy were regularized.
Since the second half of the 12th century at least, the
kings had in times of urgent need asked for subsidies from the
church, and ever since the Saladin tithe (<i>dime saladine</i>) of Philip
Augustus this contribution had assumed the form of a tithe,
taking a tenth part of the revenue of the benefices for a given
period. Tithes of this kind were fairly frequently granted by
the clergy of France, either with the pope&rsquo;s consent or without
(this being a disputed point). After the conclusion of the
Concordat, Leo X. granted the king a tithe (<i>décime</i>) under the
pretext of a projected war against the Turks; hitherto concessions
of this kind had been made by the papacy in view of
the Crusades or of wars against heretics. The concession was
several times renewed, until, by force of custom, the levying of
these tithes became permanent. But in the middle of the 16th
century the system changed. The crown was heavily in debt,
and its needs had increased. The property of the clergy having
been threatened by the states general of 1560 and 1561, the
king proposed to them to remit the bulk of the tithes and other
dues, in return for the payment by them of a sum equivalent
to the proceeds of the taxes which he had mortgaged. A formal
contract to this effect was concluded at Poissy in 1561 between
the king and the clergy of France, represented by the prelates
who were then gathered together for the Colloquy of Poissy with
the Protestants, and some of those who had been sitting at the
states general of Pontoise. The fulfilment of this agreement was,
however, evaded by the king, who diverted part of the funds
provided by the clergy from their proper purpose. In 1580,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page917" id="page917"></a>917</span>
after a period of ten years which had been agreed on, a new
assembly of the clergy was called together and, after protesting
against this action, renewed the agreement, which was henceforward
always renewed every ten years. Such was the definitive
form of the contribution of the clergy, who also acquired the
right of themselves assessing and levying these taxes on the
holders of benefices. Thus every ten years there was a great
assembly of the clergy, the members of which were elected.
There were two stages in the election, a preliminary one in the
dioceses and a further election in the ecclesiastical provinces,
each province sending four deputies to the general assembly,
two of the first rank, that is to say, chosen from the episcopate,
and two of the second rank, which included all the other clergy.
The <i>dons gratuits</i> (benevolences) voted by the assembly comprised
a fixed sum equivalent to the old tithes and supplementary sums
paid on one occasion only, which were sometimes considerable.
The church, on her side, profited by this arrangement in order
to obtain the commutation or redemption of the taxes affecting
ecclesiastics considered as individuals. This settlement only
applied to the &ldquo;clergy of France,&rdquo; that is to say, to the clergy
of those districts which were united to the crown before the end
of the 16th century. The provinces annexed later, called <i>pays
étrangers</i>, or <i>pays conquis</i>, had in this matter, as in many others,
an arrangement of their own. At last, under Louis XV. the
edict of 1749, <i>concernant les établissements et acquisitions des gens
de mainmorte</i>, was completely effective in subordinating the
acquisition of property by ecclesiastical establishments to the
consent and control of the crown, rendering them incapable
of acquiring real property by bequests.</p>

<p>At the end of the 16th century a wise law had been made which,
in spite of the traces which it bore of past struggles, had established
a reasonable balance among the Christians of France.
The edict of Nantes, in 1598, granted the Protestants full civil
rights, liberty of conscience and public worship in many places,
and notably in all the royal <i>bailliages</i>. The Catholics, whose
religion was essentially a state religion, had never accepted this
arrangement as final, and at last, in 1685, under Louis XIV.,
the edict of Nantes was revoked and the Protestant pastors
expelled from France. Their followers were forbidden to leave
the country, but many succeeded nevertheless in escaping abroad.
The position of those who remained behind was peculiar. Laws
passed in 1715 and 1724 established the legal theory that there
were no longer any Protestants in France, but only <i>vieux catholiques</i>
and <i>nouveaux convertis</i>. The result was that henceforth
they had no longer any regular civil status, the registers containing
the lists of Catholics enjoying civil rights being kept by
the Catholic clergy.</p>

<p>The form of government established under Louis XIV. was
preserved without any fundamental modification under Louis
XV. After the death of Louis XIV., however, the regent, under
the inspiration of the duc de St Simon, made trial of a system of
which the latter had made a study while in a close correspondence
with the duke of Burgundy. It consisted in substituting for the
authority of the ministers, secretaries of state and controller-general
councils, or governmental bodies, mainly composed of
great lords and prelates. These only lasted for a few years,
when a return was made to the former organization. The parlements
had regained their ancient rights in consequence of the
parlement of Paris having, in 1715, set aside the will of Louis
XIV. as being contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom,
in that it laid down rules for the composition of the council of
regency, and limited the power of the regent. This newly
revived power they exercised freely, and all the more so since they
were the last surviving check on the royal authority. During this
reign there were numerous conflicts between them and the
government, the causes of this being primarily the innumerable
incidents to which the bull <i>Unigenitus</i> gave rise, and the increase
of taxation; proceedings against Jesuits also figure conspicuously
in the action of the parlements. They became at this period
the avowed representatives of the nation; they contested the
validity of the registration of laws in the <i>lits de justice</i>, asserting
that laws could only be made obligatory when the registration
had been freely endorsed by themselves. Before the registration
of edicts concerning taxation they demanded a statement of the
financial situation and the right of examining the accounts.
Finally, by the theory of the <i>classes</i>, which considered the various
parlements of France as parts of one and the same body, they
established among them a political union. These pretensions
the crown refused to recognize. Louis XV. solemnly condemned
them in a <i>lit de justice</i> of December 1770, and in 1771 the chancellor
Maupeou took drastic measures against them. The
magistrates of the parlement of Paris were removed, and a new
parlement was constituted, including the members of the <i>grand
conseil</i>, which had also been abolished. The <i>cour des aides</i> of
Paris, which had made common cause with the parlement, was
also suppressed. Many of the provincial parlements were reorganized,
and a certain number of useful reforms were carried
out in the jurisdiction of the parlement of Paris; the object of
these, however, was in most cases that of diminishing its importance.
These actions, the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of the chancellor Maupeou,
as they were called, produced an immense sensation. The
repeated conflicts of the reign of Louis XV. had already given
rise to a whole literature of books, pamphlets and tracts in which
the rights of the crown were discussed. At the same time the
political philosophy of the 18th century was disseminating new
principles, and especially those of the supremacy of the people
and the differentiation of powers, the government of England
also became known among the French. Thus men&rsquo;s minds were
being prepared for the Revolution.</p>

<p>The personal government of Louis XVI. from 1774 to 1789
was chiefly marked by two series of facts. Firstly, there was
the partial application of the principles propounded by the
French economists of this period, the Physiocrats, who had a
political doctrine peculiar to themselves. They were not in
favour of political liberty, but attached on the contrary to the
absolute monarchy, of which they did not fear the abuses
because they were convinced that so soon as they should be
known, reason (<i>évidence</i>) alone would suffice to make the crown
respect the &ldquo;natural and essential laws of bodies politic&rdquo;
(<i>Lois naturelles et essentielles des sociétés politiques</i>, the title of a
book by Mercier de La Rivière). On the other hand, they
favoured civil and economic liberty. They wished, in particular,
to decentralize the administration and restore to the landed
proprietors the administration and levying of taxes, which they
wished to reduce to a tax on land only. This school came into
power with Turgot, who was appointed controller-general of
the finances, and laid the foundations of many reforms. He
actually accomplished for the moment one very important
reform, namely, the suppression of the trade and craft gilds
(<i>communautés, jurandes et maîtrises</i>). This organization, which
was common to the whole of Europe (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gilds</a></span>), had taken
definitive shape in France in the 13th and 14th centuries, but
had subsequently been much abused. Turgot suppressed the
privileges of the <i>maîtres</i>, who alone had been able to work on
their own account, or to open shops and workshops, and thus
proclaimed the freedom of labour, industry and commerce.
However, the old organization, slightly amended, was restored
under his successor Necker. It was Turgot&rsquo;s purpose to organize
provincial and other inferior assemblies, whose chief business
was to be the assessment of taxes. Necker applied this idea,
partially and experimentally, by creating a few of these provincial
assemblies in various <i>généralités</i> of the <i>pays d&rsquo;élections</i>. A
general reform on these lines and on a very liberal basis was
proposed by Calonne to the assembly of notables in 1787, and
it was brought into force for all the <i>pays d&rsquo;élections</i>, though not
under such good conditions, by an edict of the same year.
Louis XVI. had inaugurated his reign by the restoration of the
parlements; all the bodies which had been suppressed by
Maupeou and all the officials whom he had dismissed were
restored, and all the bodies and officials created by him were
suppressed. But it was not long before the old struggle between
the crown and parlements again broke out. It began by the
conservative opposition offered by the parlement of Paris to
Turgot&rsquo;s reforms. But the real struggle broke out in 1787
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page918" id="page918"></a>918</span>
over the edicts coming from the assembly of notables, and
particularly over the two new taxes, the stamp duty and the
land tax. The parlement of Paris refused to register them,
asserting that the consent of the taxpayers, as represented by the
states general, was necessary to fresh taxation. The struggle
seemed to have come to an end in September; but in the
following November it again broke out, in spite of the king&rsquo;s
promise to summon the states general. It reached its height
in May 1788, when the king had created a <i>cour plénière</i> distinct
from the parlements, the chief function of which was to register
the laws in their stead. A widespread agitation arose, amounting
to actual anarchy, and was only ended by the recall of Necker
to power and the promise to convoke the states general for 1789.</p>

<p><i>Various Institutions</i>.&mdash;The permanent army which, as has
been stated above, was first established under Charles VII.,
was developed and organized during the <i>ancien
régime</i>. The <i>gendarmerie</i> or heavy cavalry was
<span class="sidenote">The army.</span>
continuously increased in numbers. On the other hand, the
<i>francs archers</i> fell into disuse after Louis XI.; and, after a
fruitless attempt had been made under Francis I. to establish
a national infantry, the system was adopted for this also of
recruiting permanent bodies of mercenaries by voluntary
enlistment. First there were the &ldquo;old bands&rdquo; (<i>vieilles bandes</i>),
chiefly those of Picardy and Piedmont, and at the end of the
16th century appeared the first regiments, the number of which
was from time to time increased. There were also in the service
and pay of the king French and foreign regiments, the latter
principally Swiss, Germans and Scots. The system of purchase
penetrated also to the army. Each regiment was the property
of a great lord; the captain was, so to speak, owner of his
company, or rather a contractor, who, in return for the sums
paid him by the king, recruited his men and gave them their
uniform, arms and equipment. In the second half of the reign
of Louis XIV. appeared the militia (<i>milices</i>). To this force each
parish had to furnish one recruit, who was at first chosen by the
assembly of the inhabitants, later by drawing lots among the
bachelors or widowers without children, who were not exempt.
The militia was very rarely raised from the towns. The purpose
for which these men were employed varied from time to time.
Sometimes, as under Louis XIV., they were formed into special
active regiments. Under Louis XV. and Louis XVI. they were
formed into <i>régiments provinciaux</i>, which constituted an organized
reserve. But their chief use was during war, when they were
individually incorporated into various regiments to fill up the
gaps.</p>

<p>Under Louis XV., with the duc de Choiseul as minister of
war, great and useful reforms were effected in the army. Choiseul
suppressed what he called the &ldquo;farming of companies&rdquo; (<i>compagnie-ferme</i>);
recruiting became a function of the state, and
voluntary enlistment a contract between the recruit and the
state. Arms, uniform and equipment were furnished by the
king. Choiseul also equalized the numbers of the military
units, and his reforms, together with a few others effected under
Louis XVI., produced the army which fought the first campaigns
of the Revolution.</p>

<p>One of the most distinctive features of the <i>ancien régime</i>
was excessive taxation. The taxes imposed by the king were
numerous, and, moreover, hardly any of them fell on
all parts of the kingdom. To this territorial inequality
<span class="sidenote">System of taxation.</span>
was added the inequality arising from privileges.
Ecclesiastics, nobles, and many of the crown officials were
exempted from the heaviest imposts. The chief taxes were the
<i>taille</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), the <i>aides</i> and the <i>gabelle</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), or monopoly of salt, the
consumption of which was generally made compulsory up to the
amount determined by regulations. In the 17th and 18th
centuries certain important new taxes were established: from
1695 to 1698 the <i>capitation</i>, which was re-established in 1701
with considerable modifications, and in 1710 the tax of the
<i>dixième</i>, which became under Louis XV. the tax of the <i>vingtièmes</i>.
These two imposts had been established on the principle of
equality, being designed to affect every subject in proportion
to his income; but so strong was the system of privileges, that
as a matter of fact the chief burden fell upon the roturiers.
The income of a roturier who was not exempt was thus subject
in turn to three direct imposts: the <i>taille</i>, the <i>capitation</i> and the
<i>vingtièmes</i>, and the apportioning or assessment of these was
extremely arbitrary. In addition to indirect taxation strictly
so called, which was very extensive in the 17th and 18th centuries,
France under the <i>ancien régime</i> was subject to the <i>traites</i>, or
customs, which were not only levied at the frontiers on foreign
trade, but also included many internal custom-houses for trade
between different provinces. Their origin was generally due to
historical reasons; thus, among the <i>provinces reputées étrangères</i>
were those which in the 14th century had refused to pay the
aids for the ransom of King John, also certain provinces which
had refused to allow customs offices to be established on their
foreign frontier. Colbert had tried to abolish these internal
duties, but had only succeeded to a limited extent.</p>

<p>The indirect taxes, the <i>traites</i> and the revenues of the royal
domain were farmed out by the crown. At first a separate
contract had been made for each impost in each <i>élection</i>, but
later they were combined into larger lots, as is shown by the
name of one of the customs districts, <i>l&rsquo;enceinte des cinq grosses
fermes</i>. From the reign of Henry IV. on the levying of each
indirect impost was farmed <i>en bloc</i> for the whole kingdom, a
system known as the <i>fermes générales</i>; but the real <i>ferme générale</i>,
including all the imposts and revenues which were farmed in
the whole of France, was only established under Colbert. The
<i>ferme générale</i> was a powerful company, employing a vast number
of men, most of whom enjoyed various privileges. Besides the
royal taxes, seigniorial imposts survived under the form of tolls
and market dues. The lords also often possessed local monopolies,
<i>e.g.</i> the right of the common bakehouse (<i>four banal</i>), which were
called the <i>banalités</i>.</p>

<p>The organization of the royal courts of justice underwent but
few modifications during the <i>ancien régime</i>. The number of
parlements, of <i>cours des aides</i> and of <i>cours des comptes</i>
increased; in the 17th century the name of <i>conseil supérieur</i>
<span class="sidenote">Courts of law.</span>
was given to some new bodies which actually
discharged the functions of the parlement, this being the period
of the decline of the parlement. In the 16th century, under
Henry II., had been created <i>présidiaux</i>, or courts of final jurisdiction,
intended to avoid numerous appeals in small cases, and
above all to avoid a final appeal to the parlements. Seigniorial
courts survived, but were entirely subordinate to the royal
jurisdictions and were badly officered by ill-paid and ignorant
judges, the lords having long ago lost the right to sit in them in
person. Their chief use was to deal with cases concerning the
payment of feudal dues to the lord. Both lawyers and people
would have preferred only two degrees of justice; and an
ordinance of May 1788 realized this desire in the main. It did
not suppress the seigniorial jurisdictions, but made their extinction
a certainty by allowing litigants to ignore them and go
straight to the royal judges. This was, however, reversed on the
recall of Necker and the temporary triumph of the parlements.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical jurisdictions survived to the end, but with
diminished scope. Their competency had been considerably
reduced by the Ordinance of Villers Cotterets of 1539,
and by an edict of 1693. But a series of ingenious legal
<span class="sidenote">Ecclesiastical courts.</span>
theories had been principally efficacious in gradually
depriving them of most of the cases which had hitherto
come under them. In the 18th century the privilege of clergy did
not prevent civil suits in which the clergy were defendants from
being almost always taken before secular tribunals, and ever since
the first half of the 17th century, for all grave offences, or <i>cas
privilégiés</i>, the royal judge could pronounce a sentence of corporal
punishment on a guilty cleric without this necessitating his
previous degradation. The inquiry into the case was, it is true,
conducted jointly by the royal and the ecclesiastical judge, but
each of them pronounced his sentence independently. All cases
concerning benefices came before the royal judges. Finally,
the <i>officialités</i> had no longer as a rule any jurisdiction over
laymen, even in the matter of marriage, except in questions of
betrothals, and sometimes in cases of opposition to marriages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page919" id="page919"></a>919</span>
The parish priests, however, continued to enter declarations of
baptisms, marriages and burials in registers kept according to
the civil laws.</p>

<p>The general customs of the <i>pays coutumiers</i> were almost all
officially recorded in the 16th century, definite procedure for
this purpose having been adopted at the end of the
15th century. Drafts were prepared by the officials
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;customs.&rdquo;</span>
of the royal courts in the chief town of the district
in which the particular customs were valid, and were then
submitted to the government. The king then appointed commissioners
to visit the district and promulgate the customs on
the spot. For the purpose of this <i>publication</i> the lords, lay and
ecclesiastical, of the district, with representatives of the towns
and of various bodies of the inhabitants, were summoned for a
given day to the chief town. In this assembly each article was
read, discussed and put to the vote. Those which were approved
by the majority were thereupon decreed (<i>décrétés</i>) by the commissioners
in the king&rsquo;s name; those which gave rise to difficulties
were put aside for the parlement to settle when it registered
the <i>coutume</i>. The <i>coutumes</i> in this form became practically
written law; henceforward their text could only be modified
by a formal revision carried out according to the same procedure
as the first version. Throughout the 16th century a fair number
of <i>coutumes</i> were thus revised (<i>reformées</i>), with the express object
of profiting by the observations and criticisms on the first text
which had appeared in published commentaries and notes, the
most important of which were those of Charles Dumoulin.
In the 16th century there had been a revival of the study of
Roman law, thanks to the historical school, among the most
illustrious representatives of which were Jacques Cujas, Hugues
Doneau and Jacques Godefroy; but this study had only slight
influence on practical jurisprudence. Certain institutions,
however, such as contracts and obligations, were regulated
throughout the whole of France by the principles of Roman law.</p>

<p>Legislation by <i>ordonnances, édits, déclarations</i> or <i>lettres
patentes</i>, emanating from the king, became more and more
frequent; but the character of the <i>grandes ordonnances</i>, which
were of a far-reaching and comprehensive nature, underwent
a change during this period. In the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries
they had been mainly <i>ordonnances de réformation</i> (<i>i.e.</i> revising
previous laws), which were most frequently drawn up after a
sitting of the states general, in accordance with the suggestions
submitted by the deputies. The last of this type was the
ordinance of 1629, promulgated after the states general of 1614
and the assemblies of notables which had followed it. In the
17th and 18th centuries they became essentially <i>codifications</i>,
comprising a systematic and detailed statement of the whole
branch of law. There are two of these series of codifying ordinances:
the first under Louis XIV., inspired by Colbert and
carried out under his direction. The chief ordinances of this
group are that of 1667 on civil procedure (code of civil procedure);
that of 1670 on the examination of criminal cases
(code of penal procedure); that of 1673 on the commerce of
merchants, and that of 1681 on the regulation of shipping, which
form between them a complete code of commerce by land and
sea. The ordinance of 1670 determined the formalities of that
secret and written criminal procedure, as opposed to the hearing
of both parties in a suit, which formerly obtained in France;
it even increased its severity, continuing the employment of
torture, binding the accused by oath to speak the truth, and
refusing them counsel save in exceptional cases. The second
series of codifications was made under Louis XV., through the
action of the chancellor d&rsquo;Aguesseau. Its chief result was the
regulation, by the ordinances of 1731, 1735 and 1747, of deeds
of gift between living persons, wills, and property left in trust.
Under Louis XVI. some mitigation was made of the criminal
law, notably the abolition of torture.</p>

<p>The feudal régime, in spite of the survival of seigniorial courts
and tolls, was no longer of any political importance; but it still
furnished the common form of real property. The fief, although
it still implied homage from the vassal, no longer involved any
service on his part (excepting that of the <i>arrière-ban</i> due to the
king); but when a fief changed hands the lord still exacted his
<i>profits</i>. Tenures held by <i>roturiers</i>, in addition to some similar
<span class="sidenote">Land tenure.</span>
rights of transfer, were generally subject to periodical
and fixed contributions for the profit of the lord. This
system was still further complicated by tenures which
were simply real and not feudal, <i>e.g.</i> that by payment of
ground rent, which were superadded to the others, and had
become all the heavier since, in the 18th century, royal rights of
transfer had been added to the feudal rights. The inhabitants
of the country districts were longing for the liberation of real
property.</p>

<p>Serfdom had disappeared from most of the provinces of the
kingdom; among all the <i>coutumes</i> which were officially codified,
not more than ten or so still recognized this institution.
<span class="sidenote">Serfdom.</span>
This had been brought about especially by the agency
of the custom by which serfs had been transformed into <i>roturiers</i>.
An edict of Louis XVI. of 1779 abolished serfdom on crown lands,
and mitigated the condition of the serfs who still existed on
the domains of individual lords. The nobility still remained a
privileged class, exempt from certain taxes. Certain offices
were restricted to the nobility; according to an edict of Louis
XVI. (1781) it was even necessary to be a noble in
<span class="sidenote">The three estates.</span>
order to become an officer in the army. In fact,
the royal favours were reserved for the nobility.
Certain rules of civil and criminal procedure also distinguished
nobles from <i>roturiers</i>. The acquisition of fiefs had ceased to
bring nobility with it, but the latter was derived from three
sources: birth, <i>lettres d&rsquo;anoblissement</i> granted by the king and
appointment to certain offices. In the 17th and 18th centuries
the peers of France can be reckoned among the nobility, forming
indeed its highest grade, though the rank of peer was still attached
to a fief, which was handed down with it; on the eve of the
Revolution there were thirty-eight lay peers. The rest of the
nation, apart from the ecclesiastics, consisted of the <i>roturiers</i>,
who were not subject to the disabilities of the serfs, but had not
the privileges of the nobility. Hence the three orders (estates)
of the kingdom: the clergy, the nobility and the <i>tiers état</i> (third
estate). An edict of Louis XVI. had made a regular civil status
possible to the Protestants, and had thrown open offices and
professions to them, though not entirely; but the exercise of
their religion was still forbidden.</p>

<p><i>The Revolution.</i>&mdash;With the Revolution France entered the
ranks of constitutional countries, in which the liberty of men is
guaranteed by fixed and definite laws; from this time on, she has
had always (except in the interval between two revolutions) a
written constitution, which could not be touched by the ordinary
legislative power. The first constitution was that of 1791;
the states general of 1789, transformed by their own will, backed
by public opinion, into the Constituent Assembly, drew it up on
their own authority. But their work did not stop there. They
abolished the whole of the old public law of France and part of
the criminal law, or rather, transformed it in accordance with
the principles laid down by the political philosophy of the 18th
century. The principles which were then proclaimed are still,
on most points, the foundation of modern French law. The
development resulting from this extraordinary impetus can be
divided into two quite distinct phases: the first, from 1789 to
the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of the 18th Brumaire in the year VIII., was the
continuation of the impulse of the Revolution; the second
includes the Consulate and the first Empire, and was, as it were,
the marriage or fusion of the institutions arising from the Revolution
with those of the <i>ancien régime</i>.</p>

<p>On the whole, the constitutional law of the Revolution is a
remarkably united whole, if we consider only the two constitutions
which were effectively applied during this first phase,
that of the 3rd of September 1791, and that of the
<span class="sidenote">The Constitutions of the Revolution.</span>
5th Fructidor in the year III. It is true that between
them occurred the ultra-democratic constitution of the
24th of June 1793, the first voted by the Convention;
but although this was ratified by the popular vote, to which it
had been directly submitted, in accordance with a principle proclaimed
by the Convention and kept in force under the Consulate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page920" id="page920"></a>920</span>
and the Empire, it was never carried into effect. It was first
suspended by the establishment of the revolutionary government
strictly so called, and after Thermidor, under the pretext of
completing it, the Convention put it aside and made a new one,
being taught by experience. As long as it existed it was the
sovereign assembly of the Convention itself which really exercised
the executive power, governing chiefly by means of its great
committees.</p>

<p>The constitution of 1791 was without doubt monarchical,
in so far as it preserved royalty. The constitution of the year
III. was, on the contrary, republican. The horror of monarchy
was still so strong at that time that an executive college was
created, a Directory of five members, one of whom retired every
year; they were elected by a complicated and curious procedure,
in which each of the two legislative councils played a distinct part.
But this difference, though apparently essential, was not in reality
very profound; this is proved, for example, by the fact that the
Directory had distinctly more extensive powers than those conferred
on Louis XVI. by the Constituent Assembly. On almost
all points of importance the two constitutions were similar.
They were both preceded by a statement of principles, a &ldquo;Declaration
of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.&rdquo; They were both
based on two principles which they construed alike: the
sovereignty of the people and the separation of powers. Both
of them (with the exception of what has been said with regard to
the ratification of constitutions after 1793) recognized only representative
government. From the principle of the sovereignty
of the people they had not deduced universal suffrage; though,
short of this, they had extended the suffrage as far as possible.
According to the constitution of 1791, in addition to the conditions
of age and residence, an elector was bound to pay a
direct contribution equivalent to three days&rsquo; work; the constitution
of the year III. recognized the payment of any direct
contribution as sufficient; it even conferred on every citizen
the right of having himself enrolled, without any other qualification
than a payment equivalent to three days&rsquo; work, and thus
to become an elector. Further, neither of the two constitutions
admitted of a direct suffrage; the elections were carried out in
two stages, and only those who paid at a higher rating could be
chosen as electors for the second stage. The executive power,
which was in the case of both constitutions clearly separated
from the legislative, could not initiate legislation. The Directory
had no veto; Louis XVI. had with difficulty obtained a merely
suspensive veto, which was overridden in the event of three
legislatures successively voting against it. The right of dissolution
was possessed by neither the king nor the Directory.
Neither the king&rsquo;s ministers nor those of the Directory could be
members of the legislative body, nor could they even be chosen
from among its ranks. The ministers of Louis XVI. had, however,
thanks to an unfortunate inspiration of the Constituent
Assembly of 1791, the right of entry to, and, to a certain extent,
of speaking in the Legislative Assembly; the constitution of the
year III. showed greater wisdom in not bringing them in any way
into contact with the legislative power. The greatest and most
notable difference between the two constitutions was that that
of 1791 established a single chamber which was entirely renewed
every two years; that of the year III., on the contrary, profiting
by the lessons of the past, established two chambers, one-third of
the members of which were renewed every year. Moreover,
the two chambers, the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of
Ancients, were appointed by the same electors, and almost the
only difference between their members was that of age.</p>

<p>The Revolution entirely abolished the <i>ancien régime</i>, and in
the first instance whatever remained of feudalism. The Constituent
Assembly, in the course of its immense work
of settlement, wished to draw distinctions, abolishing
<span class="sidenote">Abolition of the &ldquo;ancien régime.&rdquo;</span>
absolutely, without indemnity, all rights which had
amounted in the beginning to a usurpation and could
not be justified, <i>e.g.</i> serfdom and seigniorial courts of justice.
On the other hand, it declared subject to redemption such feudal
charges as had been the subject of contract or of a concession
of lands. But as it was almost impossible to discover the exact
origin of various feudal rights, the Assembly had proceeded to
do this by means of certain legal assumptions which sometimes
admitted of a proof to the contrary. It carefully regulated the
conditions and rate of repurchase, and forbade the creation in
the future of any perpetual charge which could not be redeemed:
a principle that has remained permanent in French law. This
was a rational and equitable solution; but in a period of such
violent excitement it could not be maintained. The Legislative
Assembly declared the abolishment without indemnity of all
feudal rights for which the original deed of concession could not be
produced; and to produce this was, of course, in most cases
impossible. Finally, the Convention entirely abolished all feudal
rights, and commanded that the old deeds should be destroyed;
it maintained on the contrary, though subject to redemption,
those tenures and charges which were solely connected with
landed property and not feudal.</p>

<p>With feudalism had been abolished serfdom. Further, the
Constituent Assembly suppressed nobility; it even forbade any
one to assume and bear the titles, emblems and arms of nobility.
Thus was established the equality of citizens before the law.
The Assembly also proclaimed the liberty of labour and industry,
and suppressed the corporations of artisans and workmen, the
<i>jurandes</i> and <i>maîtrises</i>, as Turgot had done. But, in order to
maintain this liberty of the individual, it forbade all associations
between workers, or employers, fearing that such contracts
would again lead to the formation of corporations similar to the
old ones. It even forbade and declared punishable, as being
contrary to the declaration of the rights of man and the citizen,
combinations or strikes, or an agreement between workmen or
employers to refuse to work or to give work except on given
conditions. Such, for a long time, was French legislation on this
point.</p>

<p>The Constituent Assembly gave to France a new administrative
division, that into departments, districts, cantons and communes;
and this division, which was intended to make the
old provincial distinctions disappear, had to serve all
<span class="sidenote">Administrative reorganization.</span>
purposes, the department being the unit for all public
services. This settlement was definitive, with the
exception of certain modifications in detail, and exists to the
present day. But there was a peculiar administrative organism
depending on this arrangement. The constitution of 1791,
it is true, made the king the titulary head of the executive
power; but the internal administration of the kingdom was not
actually in his hands. It was deputed, under his orders,
to bodies elected in each department, district and commune.
The municipal bodies were directly elected by citizens duly
qualified; other bodies were chosen by the method of double
election. Each body consisted of two parts: a council, for
deliberative purposes, and a <i>bureau</i> or <i>directoire</i> chosen by the
council from among its numbers to form the executive. These
were the only instruments for the general administration and
for that of the direct taxes. The king could, it is true, annul
the illegal acts of these bodies, but not dismiss their members;
he could merely suspend them from exercising their functions,
but the matter then went before the Legislative Assembly,
which could maintain or remit the suspension as it thought fit.
The king had not a single agent chosen by himself for general
administrative purposes. This was a reaction, though a very
exaggerated one, against the excessive centralization of the
<i>ancien régime</i>, and resulted in an absolute administrative anarchy.
The organization of the revolutionary government partly restored
the central authority; the councils of the departments were
suppressed; the Committee of Public Safety and the &ldquo;representatives
of the people on mission&rdquo; were able to remove and
replace the members of the elected bodies; and also, by an
ingenious arrangement, national agents were established in
the districts. The constitution of the year III. continued in
this course, simplifying the organization established by the
Constituent Assembly, while maintaining its principle. The
department had an administration of five members, elected as
in the past, but having executive as well as deliberative functions.
The district was suppressed. The communes retained only a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page921" id="page921"></a>921</span>
municipal agent elected by themselves, and the actual municipal
body, the importance of which was considerably increased,
was removed to the canton, and consisted of the municipal
agents from each commune, and a president elected by the duly
qualified citizens of the canton. The Directory was represented
in each departmental and communal administration by a
commissary appointed and removable by itself, and could dismiss
the members of these administrations.</p>

<p>The Constituent Assembly decided on the complete reorganization
of the judicial organization. This was accomplished on a
very simple plan, which realized that ideal of the two
degrees of justice which, as we have noticed, was
<span class="sidenote">Judicial system.</span>
that of France under the <i>ancien régime</i>. In the lower
degrees it created in each canton a justice of the peace (<i>juge de
paix</i>), the idea and name of which were borrowed from England,
but which differed very much from the English justice of the
peace. He judged, both with and without appeal, civil cases
of small importance; and, in cases which did not come within
his competency, it was his duty to try to reconcile the parties.
In each district was established a civil court composed of five
judges. This completed the judicial organization, except for
the court of cassation, which had functions peculiar to itself,
never judging the facts of the case but only the application of
the law. For cases coming under the district court, the Assembly
had not thought fit to abolish the guarantee of the appeal in
cases involving sums above a certain figure. But by a curious
arrangement the district tribunals could hear appeals from one
another. With regard to penal prosecutions, there was in each
department a criminal court which judged crimes with the
assistance of a jury; it consisted of judges borrowed from
district courts, and had its own president and public prosecutor.
Correctional tribunals, composed of <i>juges de paix</i>, dealt with
misdemeanours. The Assembly preserved the commercial
courts, or consular jurisdictions, of the <i>ancien régime</i>. There
was a court of cassation, the purpose of which was to preserve
the unity of jurisprudence in France; it dealt with matters
of law and not of fact, considering appeals based on the violation
of law, whether in point of matter or of form, and if such violation
were proved, sending the matter before another tribunal of
the same rank for re-trial. All judges were elected for a term
of years; the <i>juges de paix</i> by the primary assembly of the canton,
the district judges by the electoral assembly consisting of the
electors of the second degree for the district, the members of the
court of cassation by the electors of the departments, who were
divided for the purpose into two series, which voted alternately.
The Constituent Assembly did, it is true, require professional
guarantees, by proof of a more or less extended exercise of
the profession of lawyer from all judges except the <i>juges de paix</i>.
But the system was really the same as that of the administrative
organization. The king only appointed the <i>commissaires du roi</i>
attached to the district courts, criminal tribunals and the court
of cassation; but the appointment once made could not be
revoked by him. These commissaries fulfilled one of the functions
of the old <i>ministère public</i>, their duty being to demand the
application of laws. The Convention did not change this general
organization; but it suppressed the professional guarantees
required in the case of candidates for a judgeship, so that henceforth
all citizens were eligible; and it also caused new elections
to take place. Moreover, the Convention, either directly or by
means of one of its committees, not infrequently removed and
replaced judges without further election. The constitution of
the year III. preserved this system, but introduced one considerable
modification. It suppressed the district courts, and in
their place created in each department a civil tribunal consisting
of twenty judges. The idea was a happy one, for it gave the
courts more importance, and therefore more weight and dignity.
But this reform, beneficial as it would be nowadays, was at the
time premature, in view of the backward condition of means
of communication.</p>

<p>The Constituent Assembly suppressed the militia and maintained
the standing army, according to the old type, the numbers
of which were henceforth to be fixed every year by the Legislative
Assembly. The army was to be recruited by voluntary
enlistment, careful rules for which were drawn up; the only
<span class="sidenote">The army.</span>
change was in the system of appointment to ranks;
promotion went chiefly by seniority, and in the lower
ranks a system of nomination by equals or inferiors was
organized. The Assembly proclaimed, however, the principle
of compulsory and personal service, but under a particular
form, that of the National Guard, to which all qualified citizens
belonged, and in which almost all ranks were conferred by
election. Its chief purpose was to maintain order at home;
but it could be called upon to furnish detachments for defence
against foreign invasion. This was an institution which, with
many successive modifications, and after various long periods
of inactivity followed by a revival, lasted more than three-quarters
of a century, and was not suppressed till 1871. For
purposes of war the Convention, in addition to voluntary enlistments
and the resources furnished by the National Guards,
and setting aside the forced levy of 200,000 men in 1793, decided
on the expedient of calling upon the communes to furnish men,
a course which revived the principle of the old militia. But the
Directory drew up an important military law, that of the 6th
Fructidor of the year VI., which established compulsory military
service for all, under the form of conscription strictly so called.
Frenchmen aged from 20 to 25 (<i>défenseurs conscrits</i>) were divided
into five classes, each including the men born in the same year,
and were liable until they were 25 years old to be called up for
active service, the whole period of service not exceeding four
years. No class was called upon until the younger classes
had been exhausted, and the sending of substitutes was forbidden.
This law, with a few later modifications, provided for the French
armies up to the end of the Empire.</p>

<p>The Constituent Assembly abolished nearly all the taxes
of the <i>ancien régime</i>. Almost the only taxes preserved were
the stamp duty and that on the registration of acts
(the old <i>contrôle</i> and <i>centième denier</i>), and these were
<span class="sidenote">Taxation.</span>
completely reorganized; the customs were maintained only at
the frontiers for foreign trade. In the establishment of new
taxes the Assembly was influenced by two sentiments: the
hatred which had been inspired by the former arbitrary taxation,
and the influence of the school of the Physiocrats. Consequently
it did away with indirect taxation on objects of consumption,
and made the principal direct tax the tax on land. Next in
importance were the <i>contribution personnelle et mobilière</i> and the
<i>patentes</i>. The essential elements of the former were a sort of
capitation-tax equivalent to three days&rsquo; work, which was the
distinctive and definite sign of a qualified citizen, and a tax on
personal income, calculated according to the rent paid. The
<i>patentes</i> were paid by traders, and were also based on the amount
of rent. These taxes, though considerably modified later, are
still essentially the basis of the French system of direct taxation.
The Constituent Assembly had on principle repudiated the tax
on the gross income, much favoured under the <i>ancien régime</i>,
which everybody had felt to be arbitrary and oppressive. The
system of public contributions under the Convention was
arbitrary and revolutionary, but the councils of the Directory,
side by side with certain bad laws devised to tide over temporary
crises, made some excellent laws on the subject of taxation.
They resumed the regulation of the land tax, improving and
partly altering it, and also dealt with the <i>contribution personnelle
et mobilière</i>, the <i>patentes</i>, and the stamp and registration duties.
It was at this time, too, that the door and window tax, which
still exists, was provisionally established; there was also a
partial reappearance of indirect taxation, in particular the
<i>octrois</i> of the towns, which had been suppressed by the Constituent
Assembly.</p>

<p>The Constituent Assembly gave the Protestants liberty of
worship and full rights; it also gave Jews the status of citizen,
which they had not had under the <i>ancien régime</i>,
together with political rights. With regard to the
<span class="sidenote">Religious liberty.</span>
Catholic Church, the Assembly placed at the disposal
of the nation the property of the clergy, which had already,
in the course of the 18th century, been regarded by most political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page922" id="page922"></a>922</span>
writers as a national possession; at the same time it provided
for salaries for the members of the clergy and pensions for those
who had been monks. It abolished tithes and the religious
orders, and forbade the re-formation of the latter in the future.
The ecclesiastical districts were next reorganized, the department
being always taken as the chief unit, and a new church
was organized by the civil constitution of the clergy, the bishops
being elected by the electoral assembly of the department (the
usual electors), and the curés by the electoral assembly of the
district. This was an unfortunate piece of legislation, inspired
partly by the old Gallican spirit, partly by the theories on civil
religion of J.J. Rousseau and his school, and, together with the
civic oath imposed on the clergy, it was a source of endless
troubles. The constitutional church established in this way
was, however, abolished as a state institution by the Convention.
By laws of the years III. and IV. the Convention and the
Directory, in proclaiming the liberty of worship, declared that
the Republic neither endowed nor recognized any form of
worship. Buildings formerly consecrated to worship, which
had not been alienated, were again placed at the disposal of
worshippers for this purpose, but under conditions which were
hard for them to accept.</p>

<p>The Assemblies of the Revolution, besides the laws which,
by abolishing feudalism, altered the character of real property,
passed many others concerning civil law. The most
important are those of 1792, passed by the Legislative
<span class="sidenote">Civil law.</span>
Assembly, which organized the registers of the <i>état civil</i> kept
by the municipalities, and laid down rules for marriage
as a purely civil contract. Divorce was admitted to a practically
unlimited extent; it was possible not only for causes determined
by law, and by mutual consent, but also for incompatibility
of temper and character proved, by either husband or wife,
to be of a persistent nature. Next came the laws of the Convention
as to inheritance, imposing perfect equality among the
natural heirs and endeavouring to ensure the division of properties.
Illegitimate children were considered by these laws as on the
same level with legitimate children. The Convention and the
councils of the Directory also made excellent laws on the administration
of <i>hypothèques</i>, and worked at the preparation of a
<span class="sidenote">Criminal law.</span>
Civil Code (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Code Napoléon</a></span>). In criminal law
their work was still more important. In 1791 the
Constituent Assembly gave France her first penal
code. It was inspired by humanitarian ideas, still admitting
capital punishment, though accompanied by no cruelty in the
execution; but none of the remaining punishments was for
life. Long imprisonment with hard labour was introduced.
Finally, as a reaction against the former system of arbitrary
penalties, there came a system of fixed penalties determined,
both as to its assessment and its nature, for each offence, which
the judge could not modify. The Constituent Assembly also
reformed the procedure of criminal trials, taking English law as
model. It introduced the jury, with the double form of <i>jury
d&rsquo;accusation</i> and <i>jury de jugement</i>. Before the judges procedure
was always public and oral. The prosecution was left in principle
to the parties concerned, plaintiffs or <i>dénonciateurs civiques</i>,
and the preliminary investigation was handed over to two
magistrates; one was the <i>juge de paix</i>, as in English procedure
at this period, and the other a magistrate chosen from the
district court and called the <i>directeur du jury</i>. The Convention,
before separating, passed the <i>Code des délits et des peines</i> of the
3rd Brumaire in the year IV. This piece of work, which was
due to Merlin de Douai, was intended to deal with criminal
procedure and penal law; but only the first part could be
completed. It was the procedure established by the Constituent
Assembly, but further organized and improved.</p>

<p><i>The Consulate and the Empire.</i>&mdash;The constitutional law of
the Consulate and the Empire is to be found in a series of documents
called later the <i>Constitutions de l&rsquo;Empire</i>, the constitution
promulgated during the Hundred Days being consequently
given the name of <i>Acte additionnel aux Constitutions de l&rsquo;Empire</i>.
These documents consist of (1) the Constitution of the 22nd
Frimaire of the year VIII., the work of Sieyès and Bonaparte,
the text on which the others were based; (2) the <i>senatus consulte</i>
of the 16th Thermidor in the year X., establishing the consulate
for life; and (3) the <i>senatus consulte</i> of the 28th Floréal in the
year XII., which created the Empire. These constitutional acts,
which were all, whether in their full text or in principle, submitted
to the popular vote by means of a <i>plébiscite</i>, had all the
same object: to assure absolute power to Napoleon, while
preserving the forms and appearance of liberty. Popular suffrage
was maintained, and even became universal; but, since the
system was that of suffrage in many stages, which, moreover,
varied very much, the citizens in effect merely nominated the
candidates, and it was the Senate, playing the part of <i>grand
électeur</i> which Sieyès had dreamed of as his own, which chose
from among them the members of the various so-called elected
bodies, even those of the political assemblies. According to the
constitution of the year VIII., the first consul (to whom had
been added two colleagues, the second and third consuls, who
did not disappear until the Empire) possessed the executive
power in the widest sense of the word, and he alone could initiate
legislation. There were three representative assemblies in
existence, elected as we have seen; but one of them, the Corps
Législatif, passed laws without discussing them, and without
the power of amending the suggestions of the government.
The Tribunate, on the contrary, discussed them, but its vote
was not necessary for the passing of the law. The Senate was
the guardian and preserver of the constitution; in addition to its
role of <i>grand électeur</i>, its chief function was to annul laws and
acts submitted to it by the Tribunate as being unconstitutional.
This original organization was naturally modified during the
course of the Consulate and the Empire; not only did the
emperor obtain the right of directly nominating senators, and
the princes of the imperial family, and grant dignitaries of the
Empire that of entering the Senate by right; but a whole body,
the Tribunate, which was the only one which could preserve
some independence, disappeared, without resort having been
had to a plebiscite; it was modified and weakened by <i>senatus
consulte</i> of the year X., and was suppressed in 1807 by a mere
<i>senatus consulte</i>. The importance of another body, on the
contrary, the <i>conseil d&rsquo;état</i>, which had been formed on the
improved type of the ancient <i>conseil du roi</i>, and consisted of
members appointed by Napoleon and carefully chosen, continually
increased. It was this body which really prepared and
discussed the laws; and it was its members who advocated
them before the Corps Législatif, to which the Tribunate also
sent orators to speak on its behalf. The ministers, who had no
relation with the legislative power, were merely the agents
of the head of the state, freely chosen by himself. Napoleon,
however, found these powers insufficient, and arrogated to
himself others, a fact which the Senate did not forget when it
proclaimed his downfall. Thus he frequently declared war upon
his own authority, in spite of the provisions to the contrary
made by the constitution of the year VIII.; and similarly, under
the form of <i>décrets</i>, made what were really laws. They were
afterwards called <i>décrets-lois</i>, and those that were not indissolubly
associated with the political régime of the Empire, and survived
it, were subsequently declared valid by the court of cassation,
on the ground that they had not been submitted to the Senate
as unconstitutional, as had been provided by the constitution
of the year VIII.</p>

<p>This period saw the rise of a whole new series of great organic
laws. For administrative organization, the most important
was that of the 28th Pluviôse in the year VIII. It
established as chief authority for each department a
<span class="sidenote">Administrative changes under Consulate and Empire.</span>
prefect, and side by side with him a <i>conseil général</i>
for deliberative purposes; for each <i>arrondissement</i>
(corresponding to the old <i>district</i>) a sub-prefect (<i>sous-préfet</i>)
and a <i>conseil d&rsquo;arrondissement</i>; and for each
<i>commune</i>, a mayor and a municipal council. But all
these officials, both the members of the councils and the individual
agents, were appointed by the head of the state or by the prefect,
so that centralization was restored more completely than ever.
Together with the prefect there was also established a <i>conseil</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page923" id="page923"></a>923</span>
<i>de préfecture</i>, having administrative functions, and generally
acting as a court of the first instance in disputes and litigation
arising out of the acts of the administration; for the Constituent
Assembly had removed such cases from the jurisdiction of the
civil tribunals, and referred them to the administrative bodies
themselves. The final appeal in these disputes was to the <i>conseil
d&rsquo;état</i>, which was supreme judge in these matters. In 1807
was created another great administrative jurisdiction, the <i>cour
des comptes</i>, after the pattern of that which had existed under
the <i>ancien régime</i>.</p>

<p>Judicial organization had also been fundamentally altered.
The system of election was preserved for a time in the case of
the <i>juges de paix</i> and the members of the court of
cassation, but finally disappeared there, even where
<span class="sidenote">Judicial changes.</span>
it had already been no more than a form. The
magistrates were in principle appointed for life, but under the
Empire a device was found for evading the rule of irremovability.
For the judgment of civil cases there was a court of first instance
in every arrondissement, and above these a certain number of
courts of appeal, each of which had within its province several
departments. The separate criminal tribunals were abolished
in 1809 by the <i>Code d&rsquo;Instruction Criminelle</i>, and the magistrates
forming the <i>cour d&rsquo;assises</i>, which judged crimes with the aid of
a jury, were drawn from the courts of appeal and from the civil
tribunals. The <i>jury d&rsquo;accusation</i> was also abolished by the
<i>Code d&rsquo;Instruction Criminelle</i>, and the right of pronouncing the
indictment was transferred to a chamber of the court of appeal.
The correctional tribunals were amalgamated with the civil
tribunals of the first instance. The <i>tribunal de cassation</i>, which
took under the Empire the name of <i>cour de cassation</i>, consisted
of magistrates appointed for life, and still kept its powers.
The <i>ministère public</i> (consisting of imperial <i>avocats</i> and <i>procureurs</i>)
was restored in practically the same form as under the <i>ancien
régime</i>.</p>

<p>The former system of taxation was preserved in principle,
<span class="sidenote">Taxation.</span>
but with one considerable addition: Napoleon re-established
indirect taxation on articles of consumption, which
had been abolished by the Constituent Assembly;
the chief of these were the duties on liquor (<i>droits réunis</i>, or
excise) and the monopoly of tobacco.</p>

<p>The Concordat concluded by Napoleon with the papacy on
the 26th Messidor of the year IX. re-established the Catholic
religion in France as the form of worship recognized
and endowed by the state. It was in principle drawn
up on the lines of that of 1516, and assured to the
<span class="sidenote">The Concordat.</span>
head of the French state in his dealings with the papacy the
same prerogatives as had formerly been enjoyed by the kings;
the chief of these was that he appointed the bishops, who afterwards
had to ask the pope for canonical institution. The
territorial distribution of dioceses was preserved practically
as it had been left by the civil constitution of the clergy. The
state guaranteed the payment of salaries to bishops and curés;
and the pope agreed to renounce all claims referring to the
appropriation of the goods of the clergy made by the Constituent
Assembly. Later on, a decree restored to the <i>fabriques</i> (vestries)
such of their former possessions as had not been alienated,
and the churches which had not been alienated were restored
for the purposes of worship. The law of the 18th Germinal
in the year X., ratifying the Concordat, reasserted, under the
name of <i>articles organiques du culte catholique</i>, all the main
principles contained in the old doctrine of the liberties of the
Gallican Church. The Concordat did not include the restoration
of the religious orders and congregations; Napoleon sanctioned
by decrees only a few establishments of this kind.</p>

<p>One important creation of the Empire was the university.
The <i>ancien régime</i> had had its universities for purposes of instruction
and for the conferring of degrees; it had
also, though without any definite organization, such
<span class="sidenote">The university.</span>
secondary schools as the towns admitted within their
walls, and the primary schools of the parishes. The Revolution
suppressed the universities and the teaching congregations.
The constitution of the year III. proclaimed the liberty of
instruction and commanded that public schools, both elementary
and secondary, should be established. Under the Directory
there was in each department an <i>école centrale</i>, in which all
branches of human knowledge were taught. Napoleon, developing
ideas which had been started in the second half of the 18th
century, founded by laws and decrees of 1806, 1808 and 1811
the Université de France, which provided and organized higher,
secondary and primary education; this was to be the monopoly
of the state, carried on by its <i>facultés</i>, <i>lycées</i> and primary schools.
No private educational establishment could be opened without
the authorization of the state.</p>

<p>But chief among the documents dating from this period are
the Codes, which still give laws to France. These are the Civil
Code of 1804, the <i>Code de Procédure Civile</i> of 1806,
the <i>Code de Commerce</i> of 1807, the <i>Code d&rsquo;Instruction Criminelle</i>
<span class="sidenote">The Codes.</span>
of 1809, and the <i>Code Pénal</i> of 1810.
These monumental works, in the elaboration of which the <i>conseil
d&rsquo;état</i> took the chief part, contributed, to a greater or less
extent, towards the fusion of the old law of France with the laws
of the Revolution. It was in the case of the <i>Code Civil</i> that this
task presented the greatest difficulty (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Code Napoléon</a></span>).
The <i>Code de Commerce</i> was scarcely more than a revised and
emended edition of the <i>ordonnances</i> of 1673 and 1681; while the
<i>Code de Procédure Civile</i> borrowed its chief elements from the
<i>ordonnance</i> of 1667. In the case of the <i>Code d&rsquo;Instruction
Criminelle</i> a distinctly new departure was made; the procedure
introduced by the Revolution into courts where judgment was
given remained public and oral, with full liberty of defence;
the preliminary procedure, however, before the examining court
(<i>juge d&rsquo;instruction</i> or <i>chambre des mises en accusation</i>) was
borrowed from the <i>ordonnance</i> of 1670; it was the procedure
of the old law, without its cruelty, but secret and written, and
generally not in the presence of both parties. The <i>Code Pénal</i>
maintained the principles of the Revolution, but increased the
penalties. It substituted for the system of fixed penalties, in
cases of temporary punishment, a maximum and a minimum,
between the limits of which judges could assess the amount.
Even in the case of misdemeanours, it admitted the system of
extenuating circumstances, which allowed them still further to
decrease and alter the penalty in so far as the offence was mitigated
by such circumstances. (See further under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Napoleon I</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>The Restored Monarchy.</i>&mdash;The Restoration and the Monarchy
of July, though separated by a revolution, form one period in
the history of French institutions, a period in which
the same régime was continued and developed. This
<span class="sidenote">Constitutional monarchy.</span>
was the constitutional monarchy, with a parliamentary
body consisting of two chambers, a system imitated
from England. The same constitution was preserved under
these two monarchies&mdash;the charter granted by Louis XVIII.
in 1814. The revolution of 1830 took place in defence of the
charter which Charles X. had violated by the <i>ordonnances</i>
of July, so that this charter was naturally preserved under the
&ldquo;July Monarchy.&rdquo; It was merely revised by the Chamber of
Deputies, which had been one of the movers of the revolution,
and by what remained of the House of Peers. In order to give
the constitution the appearance of originating in the will of the
people, the preface, which made it appear to be a favour granted
by the king, was destroyed. The two chambers acquired the
initiative in legislation, which had not been recognized as theirs
under the Restoration, but from this time on belonged to them
equally with the king. The sittings of the House of Peers were
henceforth held in public; but this chamber underwent another
and more fundamental transformation. The peers were nominated
by the king, with no limit of numbers, and according
to the charter of 1814 their appointment could be either for life
or hereditary; but, in execution of an ordinance of Louis XVIII.,
during the Restoration they were always appointed under the
latter condition. Under the July Monarchy their tenure of
office was for life, and the king had to choose them from among
twenty-two classes of notables fixed by law. The franchise
for the election of the Chamber of Deputies had been limited
by a system of money qualifications; but while, under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page924" id="page924"></a>924</span>
Restoration, it had been necessary, in order to be an elector,
to pay three hundred francs in direct taxation, this sum was
reduced in 1831 to two hundred francs, while in certain cases even
a smaller amount sufficed. In order to be elected as a deputy
it was necessary, according to the charter of 1814, to pay a
thousand francs in direct taxation, and according to that of 1830
five hundred francs. From 1817 onwards there was direct
suffrage, the electors directly electing the deputies. The idea of
those who had framed the charter of 1814 had been to give the
chief influence to the great landed proprietors, though the means
adopted to this end were not adequate: in 1830 the chief aim
had been to give a preponderating influence to the middle and
lower middle classes, and this had met with greater success.
The House of Peers, under the name of <i>cour des pairs</i>, had also
the function of judging attempts and plots against the security
of the state, and it had frequently to exercise this function both
under the Restoration and the July Monarchy.</p>

<p>This was a period of parliamentary government; that is, of
government by a cabinet, resting on the responsibility of the
ministers to the Chamber of Deputies. The only interruption
was that caused by the resistance of Charles X. at the end of his
reign, which led to the revolution of July. Parliamentary government
was practised regularly and in an enlightened spirit under
the Restoration, although the Chamber had not then all the
powers which it has since acquired. It is noteworthy that during
this period the right of the House of Peers to force a ministry to
resign by a hostile vote was not recognized. By the creation of a
certain number of new peers, a <i>fournée de pairs</i>, as it was then
called, the majority in this House could be changed when
necessary. But the government of the Restoration had to deal
with two extreme parties of a very opposite nature: the <i>Ultras</i>,
who wished to restore as far as possible the <i>ancien régime</i>, to
whom were due the acts of the <i>chambre introuvable</i> of 1816, and
later the laws of the ministry of Villèle, especially the law of
sacrilege and that voting compensation to the dispossessed
nobles, known as the <i>milliard des émigrés</i>; and on the other
hand the <i>Liberals</i>, including the Bonapartists and Republicans,
who were attached to the principles of the Revolution. In order
to prevent either of these parties from predominating in the
chamber, the government made a free use of its power of dissolution.
It further employed two means to check the progress
of the Liberals; firstly, there were various alterations successively
made in the electoral law, and the press laws, frequently restrictive
in their effect, which introduced the censorship and a preliminary
authorization in the case of periodical publications, and gave
the correctional tribunals jurisdiction in cases of press offences.
The best electoral law was that of 1817, and the best press laws
were those of 1819; but these were not of long duration. Under
the July Monarchy parliamentary government, although its
machinery was further perfected, was not so brilliant. The
majorities in the Chamber of Deputies were often uncertain, so
much so, that more than once the right of dissolution was exercised
in order to try by new elections to arrive at an undivided
and certain majority. King Louis Philippe, though sober-minded,
wished to exercise a personal influence on the policy
of the cabinet, so that there were then two schools, represented
respectively by Thiers and Guizot, one of which held the theory
that &ldquo;the king reigns but does not govern&rdquo;; while the other
maintained that he might exercise a personal influence, provided
that he could rely on a ministry supported by a majority of the
Chamber of Deputies. But the weak point in the July Monarchy
was above all the question of the franchise. A powerful movement
of opinion set in towards demanding an extension, some
wishing for universal suffrage, but the majority proposing what
was called the <i>adjonction des capacités</i>, that is to say, that to the
number of qualified electors should be added those citizens who,
by virtue of their professions, capacity or acquirements, were
inscribed after them on the general list for juries. But the
government obstinately refused all electoral reform, and held
to the law of 1831. It also refused parliamentary reform, by
which was meant a rule which would have made most public
offices incompatible with the position of deputy, the Chamber of
Deputies being at that time full of officials. The press, thanks
to the Charter, was perfectly free, without either censorship
or preliminary authorization, and press offences were judged by
a jury.</p>

<p>In another respect also the Restoration and the July Monarchy
were at one, the second continuing the spirit of the first, viz.
in maintaining in principle the civil, legal and administrative
institutions of the Empire. The preface to
<span class="sidenote">The system of the Empire retained.</span>
the charter of 1814 sanctioned and guaranteed most
of the legal rights won by the Revolution; even the
alienation of national property was confirmed. It
was said, it is true, that the old nobility regained their titles, and
that the nobility of the Empire kept those which Napoleon had
given them; but these were merely titles and nothing more;
there was no privileged nobility, and the equality of citizens
before the law was maintained. Judicial and administrative
organization, the system of taxation, military organization, the
relations of church and state, remained the same, and the university
also continued to exist. The government did, it is true,
negotiate a new Concordat with the papacy in 1817, but did not
dare even to submit it to the chambers. The most important
reform was that of the law concerning recruiting for the army.
The charter of 1814 had promised the abolition of conscription,
in the form in which it had been created by the law of the year
VI. The law of the 10th of March 1818 actually established
a new system. The contingent voted by the chambers for annual
incorporation into the standing army was divided up among all
the cantons; and, in order to furnish it, lots were drawn among
all the men of a certain class, that is to say, among the young
Frenchmen who arrived at their majority that year. Those
who were not chosen by lot were definitely set free from military
service. The sending of substitutes, a custom which had been
permitted by Napoleon, was recognized. This was the type of all
the laws on recruiting in France, of which there were a good
number in succession up to 1867. On other points they vary, in
particular as to the duration of service, which was six years,
and later eight years, under the Restoration; but the system
remained the same.</p>

<p>The Restoration produced a code, the <i>Code forestier</i> of 1827,
for the regulation of forests (<i>eaux et forêts</i>). In 1816 a law had
abolished divorce, making marriage indissoluble, as it had been
in the old law. But the best laws of this period were those on
finance. Now, for the first time, was introduced the practice of
drawing up regular budgets, voted before the year to which they
applied, and divided since 1819 into the budget of expenditure
and budget of receipts.</p>

<p>Together with other institutions of the Empire, the Restoration
had preserved the exaggerated system of administrative
centralization established in the year VIII.; and proposals for
its relaxation submitted to the chambers had come to nothing.
It was only under the July Monarchy that it was relaxed. The
municipal law of the 21st of March 1831 made the municipal
councils elective, and extended widely the right of voting in the
elections for them; the <i>maires</i> and their assistants continued
to be appointed by the government, but had to be chosen from
among the members of the municipal councils. The law of the
22nd of June 1833 made the general councils of the departments
also elective, and brought the <i>adjonction des capacités</i> into effect
for their election. The powers of these bodies were enlarged in
1838, and they gained the right of electing their president.
In 1833 was granted another liberty, that of primary education;
but in spite of violent protestations, coming especially from the
Catholics, secondary and higher education continued to be a
monopoly of the state. Many organic laws were promulgated,
one concerning the National Guard, which was reorganized in
order to adapt it to the system of citizen qualifications; one in
1832 on the recruiting of the army, fixing the period of service at
seven years; and another in 1834 securing the status of officers.
A law of the 11th of June 1842 established the great railway
lines. In 1832 the <i>Code Pénal</i> and <i>Code d&rsquo;Instruction Criminelle</i>
were revised, with the object of lightening penalties; the system
of extenuating circumstances, as recognized by a jury, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page925" id="page925"></a>925</span>
extended to the judgment of all crimes. There was also a revision
of Book III. of the <i>Code de Commerce</i>, treating of bankruptcy.
Finally, from this period date the laws of the 3rd of May
1841, on expropriation for purposes of public utility, and of the
30th of June 1838, on the treatment of the insane, which is still
in force. Judicial organization remained as it was, but the
amount of the sum up to which civil tribunals of the first instance
could judge without appeal was raised from 1000 francs to 1500,
and the competency of the <i>juges de paix</i> was widened.</p>

<p><i>The Second Republic and the Second Empire.</i>&mdash;From the point
of view of constitutional law, the Second Republic and the Second
Empire were each in a certain sense a return to the past. The
former revived the tradition of the Assemblies of the Revolution;
the latter was obviously and avowedly an imitation of the Consulate
and the First Empire.</p>

<p>The provisional government set up by the revolution of the
24th of February 1848 proclaimed universal suffrage, and by
this means was elected a Constituent Assembly, which
sat till May 1849, and, after first organizing various
<span class="sidenote">Republican constitution of 1848.</span>
forms of another provisional government, passed the
Republican constitution of the 4th of November 1848.
This constitution, which was preceded by a preface recalling
the Declarations of Rights of the Revolution, gave the legislative
power to a single permanent assembly, elected by direct universal
suffrage, and entirely renewed every three years. The executive
authority, with very extensive powers, was given to a president
of the Republic, also elected by the universal and direct suffrage
of the French citizens. The constitution was not very clear upon
the point of whether it adopted parliamentary government
in the strict sense, or whether the president, who was declared
responsible, was free to choose his ministers and to retain or
dismiss them at his own pleasure. This gave rise to an almost
permanent dispute between the president, who claimed to have
his own political opinions and to direct the government, and the
Assembly, which wished to carry on the traditions of cabinet
government and to make the ministers fully responsible to itself.
Consequently, in January 1851, a solemn debate was held, which
ended in the affirmation of the responsibility of ministers to the
Assembly. On the other hand, the president, though very
properly given great power by the constitution, was not immediately
eligible for re-election on giving up his office. Now Louis
Napoleon, who was elected president on the 10th of December
1848 by a huge majority, wished to be re-elected. Various
propositions were submitted to the Assembly in July 1851 with
a view to modifying the constitution; but they could not succeed,
as the number of votes demanded by the constitution for the
convocation of a Constituent Assembly was not reached. Moreover,
the Legislative Assembly elected in May 1849 was very
different from the Constituent Assembly of 1848. The latter was
animated by that spirit of harmony and, in the main, of adhesion
to the Republic which had followed on the February Revolution.
The new assembly, on the contrary, was composed for the most
part of representatives of the old parties, and had monarchist
aspirations. By the unfortunate law of the 31st of May 1850 it
even tried by a subterfuge to restrict the universal suffrage
guaranteed by the constitution. It suspended the right of holding
meetings, but, on the whole, respected the liberty of the press.
It was especially impelled to these measures by the growing
fear of socialism. The result was the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of the 2nd of
December 1851. A detail of some constitutional importance
is to be noticed in this period. The <i>conseil d&rsquo;état</i>, which had
remained under the Restoration and the July Monarchy an
administrative council and the supreme arbiter in administrative
trials, acquired new importance under the Second Republic.
The ordinary <i>conseillers d&rsquo;état</i> (<i>en service ordinaire</i>) were elected
by the Legislative Assembly, and consultation with the <i>conseil
d&rsquo;état</i> was often insisted on by the constitution or by law. This
was the means of obtaining a certain modifying power as a substitute
for the second chamber, which had not met with popular
approval. During its short existence the Second Republic
produced many important laws. It abolished the penalty of
death for political crimes, and suppressed negro slavery in the
colonies. The election of <i>conseillers généraux</i> was thrown open
to universal suffrage, and the municipal councils were allowed
to elect the <i>maires</i> and their colleagues. <span class="correction" title="amended from Thd">The</span> law of the 15th
of March 1850 established the liberty of secondary education,
but it conferred certain privileges on the Catholic clergy, a clear
sign of the spirit of social conservatism which was the leading
motive for its enactment. Certain humanitarian laws were
passed, applying to the working classes.</p>

<p>With the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of the 2nd of December 1851 began a new
era of constitutional plebiscites and disguised absolutism.
The proclamations of Napoleon on the 2nd of December
contained a criticism of parliamentary government,
<span class="sidenote">Constitution of Jan. 14, 1852.</span>
and formulated the wish to restore to France the
constitutional institutions of the Consulate and the
Empire, just as she had preserved their civil, administrative
and military institutions. Napoleon asked the people for the
powers necessary to draw up a constitution on these principles;
the plebiscite issued in a vast majority of votes in his favour,
and the constitution of the 14th of January 1852 was the result.
It bore a strong resemblance to the constitution of the First
Empire after 1807. The executive power was conferred on
Louis Napoleon for ten years, with the title of president of the
Republic and very extended powers. Two assemblies were
created. The conservative Senate, composed of <i>ex officio</i> members
(cardinals, marshals of France and admirals) and life members
appointed by the head of the state, was charged with the task
of seeing that the laws were constitutional, of opposing the
promulgation of unconstitutional laws, and of receiving the
petitions of citizens; it had also the duty of providing everything
not already provided but necessary for the proper working of
the constitution. The second assembly was the <i>Corps Législatif</i>,
elected by direct universal suffrage for six years, which passed
the laws, the government having the initiative in legislation.
This body was not altogether a <i>corps des muets</i>, as in the year
VIII., but its powers were very limited; thus the general session
assured to it by the constitution was only for three months,
and it could only discuss and put to the vote amendments
approved by the <i>conseil d&rsquo;état</i>; the ministers did not in any way
come into contact with it and could not be members of it, being
responsible only to the head of the state, and only the Senate
having the right of accusing them before a high court of justice.
The <i>conseil d&rsquo;état</i> was composed in the same way and had the
same authority as it had possessed from the year VIII. to 1814;
and it was the members of it who supported projected laws
before the Corps Législatif. To this was added a Draconian
press legislation; not only were press offences, many of which
were mere expressions of opinion, judged not by a jury but by
the correctional tribunals; but further, political papers could
not be founded without an authorization, and were subject to
a regular administrative discipline; they could be warned,
suspended or suppressed without a trial, by a simple act of
the administration. The constitution of January 1852 was
still Republican in name, though less so than that of the year
VIII. The period corresponding with the Consulate was also
shorter in the case of Louis Napoleon. The year 1852 had
not come to an end before a <i>senatus consulte</i>, that of the
10th of November, ratified by a plebiscite, re-established
the imperial rank in favour of Napoleon III.; it also
<span class="sidenote">Restoration of the Empire.</span>
conferred on him certain new powers, especially with
reference to the budget and foreign treaties; thus
various cracks, which experience had revealed in the
original structure of the Empire, were filled up. This
period was called that of the <i>empire autoritaire</i>. Further features
of it were the free appointment of the <i>maires</i> by the emperor,
the oath of fidelity to him imposed on all officials, and the legal
organization of official candidatures for the elections. Two
measures marked the highest point reached by this system:
the <i>loi de sureté générale</i> of the 27th of February 1858, which
allowed the government to intern in France or Algeria, or to
exile certain French citizens, without a trial. The other was
the <i>senatus consulte</i> of the 17th of February 1858, which made
the validity of candidatures for the Corps Législatif subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page926" id="page926"></a>926</span>
to a preliminary oath of fidelity on the part of the candidate.
But for various causes, which cannot be examined here, a series
of measures was soon to be initiated which were gradually to
<span class="sidenote">The empire libéral.</span>
lead back again to political liberty, and definitively
to found what has been called the <i>empire libéral</i>.
One by one the different rules and proceedings of
parliamentary government as it had existed in France
regained their force. The first step was the decree of the 24th
of November 1860, which re-established for each ordinary session
the address voted by the chambers in response to the speech
from the throne. In 1867 this movement took a more decisive
form. It led to a new constitution, that of the 21st of May
1870, which was again ratified by popular suffrage. While
maintaining the Empire and the imperial dynasty, it organized
parliamentary government practically in the form in which it
had operated under the July Monarchy, with two legislative
chambers, the Senate and the Corps Législatif, the consent of
both of which was necessary for legislation, and which, together
with the emperor, had the initiative in this matter. The laws
of the 11th of May 1868 and the 6th of June 1868 restored to a
certain extent the liberty of the press and of holding meetings,
though without abolishing offences of opinion, or again bringing
press offences under the jurisdiction of a jury. Laws of the 22nd
and 23rd of July 1870 gave the <i>conseils généraux</i>, whose powers
had been somewhat widened, the right of electing their presidents,
and provided that the <i>maires</i> and their colleagues should be
chosen from among the members of the municipal councils.</p>

<p>The legislation of the Second Empire led to a considerable
number of reforms. Its chief aim was the development of
<span class="sidenote">Economic and social reforms under the Second Empire.</span>
commerce, industry and agriculture, and generally the
material prosperity of the country. The Empire,
though restricting liberty in political matters, increased
it in economic matters. Such were the decrees and
laws of 1852 and 1853 relating to land-banks (<i>établissements
de crédit foncier</i>) and that of 1857 on trade-marks,
those of 1863 and 1867 on commercial companies, that of 1858
on general stores (<i>magasins généraux</i>) and warrants, that of
1856 on drainage, that of 1865 on the <i>associations syndicales de
propriétaires</i>, that of 1866 on the mercantile marine. The law
of the 14th of June 1865 introduced into France the institution,
borrowed from England, of cheques. But of still greater importance
for economic development than all these laws were the
<span class="sidenote">Commercial treaties.</span>
treaties concluded by the emperor with foreign powers,
in order to introduce, as far as possible, free exchange
of commodities; the chief of these, which was the
model of all the others, was that concluded with Great
Britain on the 23rd of January 1860. Moreover, the law of
the 25th of May 1864 admitted for the first time the right of
strikes and lock-outs among workmen or employers, annulling
articles 414 and following of the <i>Code Pénal</i>, which had so far
made them a penal offence, even when not accompanied by
fraudulent practices, threats or violence, tending to hinder the
liberty of labour. The superannuation fund (<i>caisse des retraites
pour la vieillesse</i>), supported by voluntary payments from those
participating in it, which had been created by the law of the 18th
of June 1850, was reorganized and perfected, and a law of the
11th of July 1868 established, with the guarantee of the state,
two funds for voluntary insurance, one in case of death, the other
against accidents occurring in industrial or agricultural employment.
A decree of 1863 established in principle the freedom
of bakeries, and another in 1864 that of theatrical management.</p>

<p>Criminal law was the subject of important legislation. Two
codes were promulgated on special points, the codes of military
justice for the land forces (1857) and for the naval
forces (1858). But the common law was also largely
<span class="sidenote">Reforms in the criminal law.</span>
remodelled. A law of the 10th of June 1858, it is true,
created certain new crimes, with a view to protecting
the members of the imperial family, and that of the 17th of
July 1856 increased the powers and independence of the <i>juges
d&rsquo;instruction</i>; but, on the other hand, useful improvements
were introduced by laws of 1856 and 1865, and notably with
regard to precautionary detention and provisional release with or
without bail. A law of the 20th of May 1863 organized a simple
and rapid procedure, copied from that followed in England
before the police courts, for summary jurisdiction. A law of
1868 permitted the revision of criminal trials after the death
of the condemned person. But the most far-reaching reforms
took place in 1854, namely, the abolition of the total loss of
civil rights which formerly accompanied condemnation to
imprisonment for life, and the law of the 30th of May on penal
servitude (<i>travaux forcés</i>) which substituted transportation to
the colonies for the system of continental convict prisons.
Finally, in 1863, there was a revision of the <i>Code Pénal</i>, which,
in the process of lightening penalties, made a certain number of
crimes into misdemeanours, and in consequence transferred
<span class="sidenote">Civil legislation.<br />
Taxation and army.</span>
the judgment of them from the assize courts to the
correctional tribunals. In civil legislation may be
noted the law of the 23rd of March 1855 on hypothecs
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Code Napoléon</a></span>); that of the 22nd of July 1857,
which abolished seizure of the person (<i>contrainte par corps</i>) for
civil and commercial debts; and finally, the law of the 14th
of July 1866, on literary copyright. The system of taxation was
hardly modified at all, except for the establishment
of a tax on the income arising from investments
(shares and bonds of companies) in 1857, and the tax
on carriages (1862). On the 1st of February 1868
was promulgated an important military law, which, however,
passed the Corps Législatif with some difficulty. It asserted
the principle of universal compulsory military service, at least,
in time of war. It preserved, however, the system of drawing
lots to determine the annual contingent to be incorporated
into the standing army; the term of service was fixed at five
years, and it was still permissible to send a substitute. But
able-bodied men who were not included in the annual contingent
formed a reserve force called the <i>garde nationale mobile</i>, each
department organizing its own section. These <i>gardes mobiles</i>,
though they were not effectively organized or exercised under the
Empire, took part in the war of 1870-71.</p>

<p><i>The Third Republic.</i>&mdash;The Third Republic had at first a
provisional government, unanimously acclaimed by the people
of Paris. It was accepted by France, exercised full powers,
and sustained by no means ingloriously a desperate struggle
against the enemy; a certain number of its <i>décrets-lois</i> are still
in force. After the capitulation of Paris, a National Assembly
was elected to treat with Germany. It was elected in accordance
with the electoral law of 1849, which had been revived with a
few modifications, and it met at Bordeaux to the number of
753 members on the 13th of February 1871. It was a sovereign
assembly, since France had no longer a constitution, and for
this very reason it claimed from the outset constituent powers;
the Republican party at the time, however, contested this claim,
the majority in the assembly being frankly monarchist, though
divided as to the choice of a monarch. But for some time the
National Assembly either could not or would not exercise this
power, and up to 1875 affairs remained in a provisional state,
legalized and regulated this time by the Assembly. This was an
application, though unconscious, of a form of government which
M. Grévy had proposed to the Constituent Assembly in 1848.
There was a single assembly, with one man elected by it as head
of the executive power (the first to be elected was M. Thiers,
who received the title of president of the Republic in August
1871), who was responsible to the Assembly and governed with
the help of ministers chosen by himself, who were also responsible
to it. Thiers fell on the 24th of May 1873. His place was taken
by Marshal MacMahon, on whom the Assembly later conferred, in
November 1873, the position of president of the Republic for
seven years, when the refusal of the comte de Chambord to
accept the tricolour in place of the white flag of the Bourbons
had made any attempt to restore the monarchy impossible.
Henceforth the definitive adoption of the Republican form of
government became inevitable, and the opinion of the country
began to turn in this direction, as was shown by the elections
of deputies which took place to fill up the gaps occurring in the
Assembly. The Assembly, however, shrank from the inevitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page927" id="page927"></a>927</span>
solution, and when a discussion was begun in January 1875 on
the projected constitutional laws prepared by the <i>commission
des trente</i>, the only proposals made by the latter were for a more
complete organization of the powers of one man, Marshal
MacMahon. But on the 30th of January 1875 was adopted,
by 353 votes to 352, an amendment by M. Wallon which provided
for the election of an indefinite succession of presidents of the
<span class="sidenote">Definitive establishment of the Republic.</span>
Republic; this amounted to a definitive recognition
of the Republic. In this connexion it has often been
said that the Republic was established by a majority
of one. This is not an accurate statement, for it was
only the case on the first reading of the law; the
majority on the second and third readings increased until it
became considerable. There was a strong movement in the
direction of a reconciliation between the parties; and there had
been a <i>rapprochement</i> between the Republicans and the Right
Centre. At the end of February were passed and promulgated
two constitutional laws, that of the 25th of February 1875, on
the organization of the public powers, and that of the 24th of
February 1875, on the organization of the senate. In the middle
of the year they were supplemented by a third, that of the 16th
of July 1875, on the relations between the public powers.</p>

<p>Thus was built up the actual constitution of France. It
differs fundamentally, both in form and contents, from previous
constitutions. As to its form, instead of a single
methodical text divided into an uninterrupted series of
<span class="sidenote">The French Constitution.</span>
articles, it consisted of three distinct laws. As to
matter, it is obviously a work of an essentially practical
nature, the result of compromise and reciprocal concessions.
It does not lay down any theoretical principles, and its provisions,
which were arrived at with difficulty, confine themselves strictly
to what is necessary to ensure the proper operation of the
governmental machinery. The result is a compromise between
Republican principles and the rules of constitutional and parliamentary
monarchy. On this account it has been accused, though
unjustly, of being too monarchical. Its duration, by far the
longest of any French constitution since 1791, is a sign of its
value and vitality. It is in fact a product of history, and not
of imagination. Its composition is as follows. The legislative
power was given to two elective chambers, having equal powers,
the vote of both of which is necessary for legislation, and both
having the right of initiating and amending laws. The constitution
assures them an ordinary session of five months, which
opens by right on the second Tuesday in January. One house,
the Chamber of Deputies, is elected by direct universal suffrage
and is entirely renewed every four years; the other, the Senate,
consists of 300 members, divided by the law of the 27th of
February 1875 into two categories; 75 of the senators were
elected for life and irremovable, and the first of them were elected
by the National Assembly, but afterwards it was the Senate
itself which held elections to fill up vacancies. The 225 remaining
senators were elected by the departments and by certain colonies,
among which they were apportioned in proportion to the population;
they are elected for nine years, a third of the house being
renewed every three years. The electoral college in each department
which nominated them included the deputies, the members
of the general council of the department and of the councils
of the arrondissements, and one delegate elected by each municipal
council, whatever the importance of the commune. This was
practically a system of election in two and, partly, three degrees,
but with this distinguishing feature, that the electors of the
second degree had not been chosen purely with a view to this
election, but chiefly for the exercise of other functions. The
most important elements in this electoral college were the
delegates from the municipal councils, and by giving one delegate
to each, to Paris just as to the smallest commune in France, the
National Assembly intended to counterbalance the power of
numbers, which governed the elections for the Chamber of
Deputies, and, at the same time, to give a preponderance to the
country districts. The 75 irremovable senators were another
precaution against the danger from violent waves of public
opinion. The executive power was entrusted to a president,
elected for seven years (as Marshal MacMahon had been in 1873),
by the Chamber and the Senate, combined into a single body
under the name of National Assembly. He is always eligible
for re-election, and is irresponsible except in case of high treason.
His powers are of the widest, including the initiative in legislation
jointly with the two chambers, the appointment to all civil and
military offices, the disposition, and, if he wish it, the leadership
of the armed forces, the right of pardon, the right of negotiating
treaties with foreign powers, and, in principle, of ratifying them
on his own authority, the consent of the two chambers being
required only in certain cases defined by the constitution. The
nomination of <i>conseillers d&rsquo;état</i> for ordinary service, whom the
National Assembly had made elective, as in 1848, and elected
itself, was restored to the president of the Republic, together
with the right of dismissing them. But these powers he can
only exercise through the medium of a ministry, politically and
jointly responsible to the chambers, and forming a council,
over which the president usually presides.</p>

<p>The French Republic is essentially a parliamentary republic.
The right of dissolving the Chamber of Deputies before the
expiration of its term of office belongs to the president, but in
order to do so he must have, besides a ministry which will take
the responsibility for it, the preliminary sanction of the Senate.
The Senate is at the same time a high court of justice, which can
judge the president of the Republic and ministers accused of
crimes committed by them in the exercise of their functions;
in these two cases the prosecution is instituted by the Chamber
of Deputies. The Senate can also be called upon to judge any
person accused of an attempt upon the safety of the state, who
is then seized by a decree of the president of the Republic,
drawn up in the council of ministers. Possible revision of the
constitution is provided for very simply: it has to be proposed
as a law, and for its acceptance a resolution passed by each
chamber separately, by an absolute majority, is necessary.
The revision is then carried out by the Senate and the Chamber of
Deputies to form a National Assembly. There have been two
revisions since 1875. The first time, in 1879, it was simply a
question of transferring the seat of the government and of the
chambers back to Paris from Versailles, where it had been fixed
by one of the constitutional laws. The second time, in 1884,
more fundamental modifications were required. The most
important point was to change the composition and election
of the Senate. With a view to this, the new constitutional law
of the 14th of August 1884 abolished the constitutional character
of a certain number of articles of the law of the 24th of February
1875, thus making it possible to modify them by an ordinary
law. This took place in the same year; the 75 senators for life
were suppressed for the future by a process of extinction, and
their seats divided among the most populous departments.
Further, in the electoral college which elects the senators, there
was allotted to the municipal councils a number of delegates
proportionate to the number of members of the councils, which
depends on the importance of the commune. The law of the
14th of August 1884 also modified the constitution in another
important respect. The law of the 25th of February 1875 had
admitted the possibility not only of a partial, but even of a total
revision, which could affect and even change the form of the
state. The law of the 14th of August 1884, however, declared
that no proposition for a revision could be accepted which
aimed at changing the republican form of government. The
composition of the Chamber of Deputies was not fixed by the
constitution, and consequently admitted more easily of variation.
Since 1871 the mode of election has oscillated between the <i>scrutin
de liste</i> for the departments and the <i>scrutin uninominal</i> for the
arrondissements. The organic law of the 30th of November 1875
had established the latter system; in 1885 the <i>scrutin de liste</i>
was established by law, but in 1889 the <i>scrutin d&rsquo;arrondissement</i>
was restored; and in this same year, on account of the ambitions
of General Boulanger and the suggestion which was made for a
sort of plebiscite in his favour, was passed the law on plural
candidatures, which forbids anyone to become a candidate for
the Chamber of Deputies in more than one district at a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page928" id="page928"></a>928</span></p>

<p>The system established by the constitution of 1875 has worked
excellently in some of its departments; for instance, the mode of
electing the president of the Republic. Between 1875
and 1906 there were seven elections, sometimes under
<span class="sidenote">Working of the constitution.</span>
tragic or very difficult conditions; the election has
always taken place without delay or obstruction,
and the choice has been of the best. The high court of justice,
which has twice been called into requisition, in 1889 and in
1899-1900, has acted as an efficient check, in spite of the difficulties
confronting such a tribunal when feeling runs high.
Parliamentary government in the form set up by the constitution,
besides the criticism to which this system is open in all countries
where it is established, even in England, met with special
difficulties in France. In the first place, the useful but rather
secondary rôle assigned to the president of the Republic has by
no means satisfied all those who have occupied this high office.
Two presidents have resigned on the ground that their powers
were insufficient. Another, even after re-election, had to
withdraw in face of the opposition of the two chambers, being
no longer able to obtain a parliamentary ministry. It is difficult,
however, to accept the theory of an eminent American political
writer, Mr John W. Burgess,<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> that in order to attain to a position
of stable equilibrium, the French Republic ought to adopt the
presidential system of the United States. In France this sharp
division between the two powers has never been observed except
in those periods when the representative assemblies were powerless,
under the First and Second Empires. It is true that the
apparent multiplicity of parties and their lack of discipline,
together with the French procedure of <i>interpellations</i> and the
orders of the day by which they are concluded, make the formation
of homogeneous and lasting cabinets difficult; but since
the end of the 19th century there has been great progress in this
respect. Another difficulty arose in 1896. The Senate, appealing
to the letter of the constitution and relying on its elective character,
claimed the right of forcing a ministry to resign by its vote,
in the same way as the Chamber of Deputies. The Senate was
victorious in the struggle, and forced the ministry presided over
by M. Léon Bourgeois to resign; but the precedent is not
decisive, for in order to gain its ends the Senate had recourse to
the means of refusing to sanction the taxes, declining to consider
the proposals for the supplies necessary for the Madagascar
expedition so long as the ministry which it was attacking was
in existence. The weakest point in the French parliamentary
organism is perhaps the right of dissolution. It is difficult of
application, for the reason that the president must obtain the
preliminary consent of the Senate before exercising it; moreover,
this valuable right has been discredited by its abuse by
Marshal MacMahon in the campaign of the 16th of May 1877,
on which occasion he exercised his right of dissolution against
a chamber, the moderate but decidedly republican majority in
which <span class="correction" title="added he">he</span> was re-elected by the country.</p>

<p>The legislative reforms carried out under the Third Republic
are very numerous. As to public law, it is only possible to
mention here those of a really organic character,
chief among which are those which safeguard and
<span class="sidenote">Reforms under the Third Republic.</span>
regulate the exercise of the liberties of the individual.
The law of the 30th of June 1881, modified in 1901,
established the right of holding meetings. Public meetings,
whether for ordinary or electoral purposes, may be held without
preliminary authorization; the law of 1881 prescribed a declaration
made by a certain number of citizens enjoying full civil
and political rights, which is now remitted. The only really
restrictive provision is that which does not allow them to be
held in the public highway, but only in an enclosed space. But
this is made necessary by the customs of France. The law of the
21st of July 1881 on the press is one of the most liberal in the
world. By it all offences committed by any kind of publication
are submitted to a jury; the punishment for the mere expression
of obnoxious opinions is abolished, the only punishment being
for slander, libel, defamation, inciting to crime, and in certain
cases the publication of false news. The law of the 1st of July
1901 established in France the right of forming associations.
It recognizes the legality of all associations strictly so called,
the objects of which are not contrary to law or to public order
or morality. On condition of a simple declaration to the administrative
authority, it grants them a civil status in a wide sense
of the term. Religious congregations, on the contrary, which
<span class="sidenote">The religious congregations.</span>
are not authorized by a law, are forbidden by this law.
This was not a new principle, but the traditional rule
in France both before and after the Revolution,
except that under certain governments authorization
by decree had sufficed. As a matter of fact the unauthorized
congregations had been tolerated for a long time, although on
various occasions, and especially in 1881, their partial dissolution
had been proclaimed by decrees. The law of 1901 dissolved
them all, and made it an offence to belong to such a congregation.
The members of unauthorized congregations, and later, in 1904,
even those of the authorized congregations, were disqualified
from teaching in any kind of establishment. The liberty of
primary education was confirmed and reorganized by the law
of the 30th of October 1886, which simply deprived the clergy
of the privileges granted them by the law of 1850, though the
latter remains in force with regard to the liberty of secondary
education. A law passed by the National Assembly (July 12,
1875) established the liberty of higher education. It even went
<span class="sidenote">Education.</span>
beyond this, for it granted to students in private
<i>facultés</i> who aspired to state degrees the right of being
examined before a board composed partly of private and partly
of state professors. The law of the 18th of March 1880 abolished
this privilege. Another law, that of the 22nd of March 1882,
made primary education obligatory, though allowing parents to
send their children either to private schools or to those of the
state; the law of the 16th of June 1881 established secular
(<i>laïque</i>) education in the case of the latter. The Third Republic
also organized secondary education for girls in lycées or special
colleges (<i>collèges de fille</i>). Finally, a law of the 10th of July
1896 dealing with higher education and the faculties of the state
reorganized the universities, which form distinct bodies, enjoying
a fairly wide autonomy. A law of the 19th of December 1905,
abrogating that of the 18th Germinal in the year X., which
<span class="sidenote">Separation of church and state.</span>
had sanctioned the Concordat, proclaimed the separation
of the church from the state. It is based on the
principle of the secular state (<i>état laïque</i>) which recognizes
no form of religion, though respecting the right
of every citizen to worship according to his beliefs, and it aimed
at organizing associations of citizens, the object of which was to
collect the funds and acquire the property necessary for the
maintenance of worship, under the form of <i>associations cultuelles</i>,
differing in certain respects from the associations sanctioned
by the law of the 1st of July 1901, but having a wider scope. It
also handed over to these regularly formed associations the property
of the ecclesiastical establishments formerly in existence,
while taking precautions to ensure their proper application,
and allowed the associations the free use of the churches and
places of worship belonging to the state, the departments or the
communes. If no <i>association cultuelle</i> was founded in a parish,
the property of the former <i>fabrique</i> should devolve to the commune.
But this law was condemned by the papacy, as contrary
to the church hierarchy; and almost nowhere were <i>associations
cultuelles</i> formed, except by Protestants and Jews, who complied
with the law. After many incidents, but no church having been
closed, a new law of the 2nd of January 1907 was enacted.
It permits the public exercise of any cult, by means of ordinary
associations regulated by the law of the 1st of July 1901, and even
of public meetings summoned by individuals. Failing all associations,
either <i>cultuelles</i> or others, churches, with their ornaments
and furniture, are left to the disposition of the faithful and
ministers, for the purpose of exercising the cult; and, on certain
conditions, the long use of them can be granted as a free gift to
ministers of the cult.</p>

<p>Among the organic laws concerning administrative affairs
there are two of primary importance; that of the 10th of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page929" id="page929"></a>929</span>
August 1871, on the <i>conseils généraux</i>, considerably increased
the powers and independence of these elective bodies,
<span class="sidenote">Administrative changes.</span>
which have become important deliberative assemblies,
their sessions being held in public. The law of 1871
created a new administrative organ for the departments,
the <i>commission départmentale</i>, elected by the council-general
of the department from among its own members and
associated with the administration of the prefect. The other law
is the municipal law of the 5th of April 1884, which effected a
widespread decentralization; the <i>maires</i> and their <i>adjoints</i> are
elected by the municipal council.</p>

<p>The war of 1870-71 necessarily led to a modification of the
military organization. The law of the 25th of July 1872 established
the principle of compulsory service for all, first in
the standing army, the period of service in which was
<span class="sidenote">Reorganization of the army.</span>
fixed at five years, then in the reserve, and finally in
the territorial army. But the application of this principle
was by no means absolute, only holding good in time of war.
Each annual class was divided into two parts, by means of drawing
lots, and in time of peace one of these parts had only a year of
service with the active army. The previous exemptions, based
either on the position of supporter of the family (as in the case of
the son of a widow or aged father, &amp;c.) or on equivalent services
rendered to the state (as in the case of young ecclesiastics or
members of the teaching profession), were preserved, but only
held good for service in the active army in times of peace.
Finally, the system of conditional engagement for a year allowed
young men, for the purposes of study or apprenticeship to their
profession, only to serve a year with the active army in time of
peace. By this means it was sought to combine the advantages of
an army of veterans with those of a numerous and truly national
army. But the conditional volunteering (<i>volontariat conditionnel</i>)
for a year was open to too great a number of people, and so
brought the system into discredit. As those who profited by
it had to be clothed and maintained at their own expense, and
the sum which they had to furnish for this purpose was generally
fixed at 1500 francs, it came to be considered the privilege of
those who could pay this sum. A new law of the 15th of July 1889
lessened the difference between the two terms which it attempted
to reconcile. It reduced the term of service in the active army
to three years, and the exemptions, which were still preserved,
merely reduced the period to a year in times of peace. The same
reduction was also granted to those who were really pursuing
important scientific, technical or professional studies; the system
was so strict on this point that the number of those who profited
by those exemptions did not amount to 2000 in a year. This was
a compromise between two opposing principles; the democratic
principle of equality, being the stronger, was bound to triumph.
The law of the 21st of March 1905 reduced the term of service
in the active army to two years, but made it equal for all, admitting
of no exemption, but only certain facilities as to the age at
which it had to be accomplished.</p>

<p>In 1883 the judicial <i>personnel</i> was reorganized and reduced
in number. With the exception of a few modifications the main
<span class="sidenote">Justice and taxation.</span>
lines of judicial organization remained the same.
In 1879 the conseil d&rsquo;état was also reorganized. The
whole fabric of administrative jurisdiction was carefully
organized, and almost entirely separated from the
active administration.</p>

<p>The system of taxation has remained essentially unaltered;
we may notice, however, the laws of 1897, 1898 and 1900, which
abolished or lessened the duties on so called <i>hygienic</i> drinks
(wine, beer, cider), and the financial law of 1901, which rearranged
and increased the transfer fees, and established a system of
progressive taxation in the case of succession dues.</p>

<p>The labour laws, which generally partook of the nature
both of public and of private law, are a sign of our times. Under
the Third Republic they have been numerous, the
most notable being: the law of the 21st of March
<span class="sidenote">Labour legislation.</span>
1884 on professional syndicates, which introduced
the liberty of association in matters of this kind
before it became part of the common law (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Trade Unions</a></span>);
the law of the 9th of April 1898 on the liability for accidents
incurred during work, and those which have completed it;
that of the 22nd of December 1892 on conciliation and arbitration
in the case of collective disputes between employers and workmen;
that of the 29th of June 1893 on the hygiene and safeguarding
of workers in industrial establishments, and the laws which
regulate the work of children and women in factories; finally,
that of the 15th of July 1893 on free medical attendance (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Labour Legislation</a></span>).</p>

<p>As to criminal law, there have been more than fifty enactments,
mostly involving important modifications, due to more scientific
ideas of punishment, so that we may say that it has
been almost entirely recast since the establishment
<span class="sidenote">Criminal law.</span>
of the Third Republic. The separate system applied in
cases of preventive detention and imprisonment for short
periods; liberation before the expiry of the term of sentence,
subject to the condition that no fresh offence shall be committed
within a given time; transportation to the colonies of habitual
offenders; the remission of the penalty in the case of first
offenders, and the lapsing of the penalty when a certain time
has gone by without a fresh condemnation; greater facilities
for the rehabilitation of condemned persons, which now became
simply a matter for the courts, and occurred as a matter of
course at the end of a certain time; such were the chief results
of this legislation. Finally, the law of the 8th of December 1897
completely altered the form of the preliminary examination
before the <i>juge d&rsquo;instruction</i>, which had been the weakest point
in the French criminal procedure, though it was still held in
private; the new law made this examination really a hearing
of both sides, and made the appearance of counsel for the defence
practically compulsory.</p>

<p>As to private law, both civil and commercial, we could
enumerate between 1871 and 1906 more than a hundred laws
which have modified it, sometimes profoundly, and have for
the most part done very useful work without attracting much
attention. They are generally examined and drawn up by
commissions of competent men, and pass both chambers almost
without discussion. There have, however, been a few which
aroused public interest and even deep feeling. Firstly, there
was the law of the 27th of July 1884, and those which completed
it; this law re-established divorce, which had been abolished
since 1816, but only permitted it for certain definite causes
determined by law. On the other hand, the law of the 6th of
February 1893 increased the liberty and independence of a
woman who was simply judicially separated, in order to
encourage separation, as opposed to divorce, when the conditions
allowed it. The law of the 25th of March 1896 on the succession
of illegitimate children, who were recognized by the parents,
treated them not in the same way as legitimate children, but
gave them the title of heirs in the succession of their father and
mother, together with much greater rights than they had
possessed under the <i>Code Civil</i>. The law of the 24th of July 1899,
on the protection of children who are ill-treated or morally
neglected, also modified some of the provisions of the law
as applied to the family, with a view to greater justice and
humanity. Finally, on the occasion of the centenary of the
<i>Code Civil</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Code Napoléon</a></span>), a commission, composed
of members of the chambers, magistrates, professors of law,
lawyers, political writers, and even novelists and dramatic
authors, was given the task of revising the whole structure of
the code.</p>

<p><span class="bold">FRANCESCHI, JEAN BAPTISTE,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1766-1813), French
general, was born at Bastia on the 5th of December 1766 and
entered the French service in 1793. He took part in the operations
in Corsica in the following year, and received a wound at
the siege of San Fiorenzo. After this he left the island and was
appointed a field officer in the French Army of Italy, with which
he served from 1795 to 1799. He served as a general officer in
the campaign of Marengo, in the Naples campaign of 1805-1806,
and in the Peninsular War from 1807 to 1809. He was created
a baron by Napoleon. He commanded a Neapolitan brigade
in the Russian War of 1812, and after the retreat from Moscow
took refuge, with the remnant of his command, in Danzig,
where in the course of the siege of 1813 he died on the 19th of
March.</p>

<p>Two other generals of brigade in Napoleon&rsquo;s wars bore the
name of Franceschi, and the three have often been mistaken for
each other. The first was born at Lyons, <span class="sc">Jean Baptiste Marie
Franceschi-Delonne</span> (1767-1810), who served throughout
the Revolutionary campaign on the Rhine, took part in the
campaign of Zürich in 1799, and distinguished himself very
greatly by his escape from, and subsequent return to, Genoa,
when in 1800 Masséna was closely besieged in that city. He
became a cavalry colonel in 1803, was promoted general of
brigade on the field of Austerlitz, and served in southern Italy
and in Spain on the staff of King Joseph Bonaparte. During
the Peninsular War he won great distinction as a cavalry general,
and in 1810 Napoleon made him a baron. At this time he was a
prisoner in the hands of the Spaniards, into whose hands he had
fallen while bearing important despatches during the campaign
of Talavera. He was harshly treated by his captors, and died
at Carthagena on the 23rd of October 1810. The second was
<span class="sc">François Franceschi-Losio</span> (1770-1810), born at Milan, who
entered the French Revolutionary army in 1795. He served
through the Italian campaign of 1796-97, and subsequently,
like Franceschi-Delonne, with Masséna at Zürich and at Genoa,
and at the headquarters of King Joseph in Italy and Spain.
He was killed in a duel by the Neapolitan colonel Filangieri
in 1810.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">FRANCESCHI, PIERO<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Pietro</span>) <b>DE&rsquo;</b> (<i>c.</i> 1416-1492),
Italian painter of the Umbrian school. This master is generally
named Piero della Francesca (Peter, son of Frances), the tradition
being that his father, a woollen-draper named Benedetto, had
died before his birth. This is not correct, for the mother&rsquo;s
name was Romana, and the father continued living during
many years of Piero&rsquo;s career. The painter is also named Piero
Borghese, from his birthplace, Borgo San Sepolcro, in Umbria.
The true family name was, as above stated, Franceschi, and
the family still exists under the name of Martini-Franceschi.</p>

<p>Piero first received a scientific education, and became an
adept in mathematics and geometry. This early bent of mind
and course of study influenced to a large extent his development
as a painter. He had more science than either Paolo Uccello
or Mantegna, both of them his contemporaries, the former
older and the latter younger. Skilful in linear perspective,
he fixed rectangular planes in perfect order and measured them,
and thus got his figures in true proportional height. He preceded
and excelled Domenico Ghirlandajo in projecting shadows,
and rendered with considerable truth atmosphere, the harmony
of colours, and the relief of objects. He was naturally therefore
excellent in architectural painting, and, in point of technique,
he advanced the practice of oil-colouring in Italy.</p>

<p>The earliest trace that we find of Piero as a painter is in 1439,
when he was an apprentice of Domenico Veneziano, and assisted
him in painting the chapel of S. Egidio, in S. Maria Novella of
Florence. Towards 1450 he is said to have been with the same
artist in Loreto; nothing of his, however, can now be identified
in that locality. In 1451 he was by himself, painting in Rimini,
where a fresco still remains. Prior to this he had executed
some extensive frescoes in the Vatican; but these were destroyed
when Raphael undertook on the same walls the &ldquo;Liberation
of St Peter&rdquo; and other paintings. His most extensive extant
series of frescoes is in the choir of S. Francesco in Arezzo,&mdash;the
&ldquo;History of the Cross,&rdquo; beginning with legendary subjects of
the death and burial of Adam, and going on to the entry of
Heraclius into Jerusalem after the overthrow of Chosroes.
This series is, in relation to its period, remarkable for effect,
movement, and mastery of the nude. The subject of the &ldquo;Vision
of Constantine&rdquo; is particularly vigorous in chiaroscuro; and a
preparatory design of the same composition was so highly effective
that it used to be ascribed to Giorgione, and might even (according
to one authority) have passed for the handiwork of Correggio
or of Rembrandt. A noted fresco in Borgo San Sepolcro, the
&ldquo;Resurrection,&rdquo; may be later than this series; it is preserved
in the Palazzo de&rsquo; Conservatori. An important painting of the
&ldquo;Flagellation of Christ,&rdquo; in the cathedral of Urbino, is later
still, probably towards 1470. Piero appears to have been much
in his native town of Borgo San Sepolcro from about 1445, and
more especially after 1454, when he finished the series in Arezzo.
He grew rich there, and there he died, and in October 1492 was
buried.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Two statements made by Vasari regarding &ldquo;Piero della Francesca&rdquo;
are open to much controversy. He says that Piero became blind
at the age of sixty, which cannot be true, as he continued painting
some years later; but scepticism need perhaps hardly go to the
extent of inferring that he was never blind at all. Vasari also says
that Fra Luca Pacioli, a disciple of Piero in scientific matters,
defrauded his memory by appropriating his researches without
acknowledgment. This is hard upon the friar, who constantly
shows a great reverence for his master in the sciences. One of
Pacioli&rsquo;s books was published in 1509, and speaks of Piero as still
living. Hence it has been propounded that Piero lived to the
patriarchal age of ninety-four or upwards; but, as it is now stated
that he was buried in 1492, we must infer that there is some mistake
in relation to Pacioli&rsquo;s remark&mdash;perhaps the date of writing was
several years earlier than that of publication. Piero was known
to have left a manuscript of his own on perspective; this remained
undiscovered for a long time, but eventually was found by E. Harzen
in the Ambrosian library of Milan, ascribed to some supposititious
&ldquo;Pietro, Pittore di Bruges.&rdquo; The treatise shows a knowledge of
perspective as dependent on the point of distance.</p>

<p>In the National Gallery, London, are three paintings attributed
to Piero de&rsquo; Franceschi. Another work, a profile of Isotta da Rimini,
may safely be rejected. The &ldquo;Baptism of Christ,&rdquo; which used to be
the altar-piece of the Priory of the Baptist in Borgo San Sepolcro,
is an important example; and still more so the &ldquo;Nativity,&rdquo; with the
Virgin kneeling, and five angels singing to musical instruments.
This is a very interesting and characteristic specimen, and has
indeed been praised somewhat beyond its deservings on aesthetic
grounds.</p>

<p>Piero&rsquo;s earlier style was energetic but unrefined, and to the last
he lacked selectness of form and feature. The types of his visages
are peculiar, and the costumes (as especially in the Arezzo series)
singular. He used to work assiduously from clay models swathed
in real drapery. Luca Signorelli was his pupil, and probably to
some extent Perugino; and his own influence, furthered by that of
Signorelli, was potent over all Italy. Belonging as he does to the
Umbrian school, he united with that style something of the Sienese
and more of the Florentine mode.</p>

<p>Besides Vasari and Crowe &amp; Cavalcaselle, the work by W.G.
Waters, <i>Piero della Francesca</i> (1899) should be consulted.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">FRANCESCHINI, BALDASSARE<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (1611-1689), Italian painter
of the Tuscan school, named, from Volterra the place of his
birth, Il Volterrano, or (to distinguish him from Ricciarelli)
Il Volterrano Giuniore, was the son of a sculptor in alabaster.
At a very early age he learned from Cosimo Daddi some of the
elements of art, and he started as an assistant to his father.
This employment being evidently below the level of his talents,
the marquises Inghirami placed him, at the age of sixteen, under
the Florentine painter Matteo Rosselli. In the ensuing year he
had advanced sufficiently to execute in Volterra some frescoes,
skilful in foreshortening, followed by other frescoes for the
Medici family in the Valle della Petraia. In 1652 the marchese
Filippo Niccolini, being minded to employ Franceschini upon the
frescoes for the cupola and back-wall of his chapel in S. Croce,
Florence, despatched him to various parts of Italy to perfect
his style. The painter, in a tour which lasted some months,
took more especially to the qualities distinctive of the schools
of Parma and Bologna, and in a measure to those of Pietro
da Cortona, whose acquaintance he made in Rome. He then
undertook the paintings commissioned by Niccolini, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page931" id="page931"></a>931</span>
constitute his most noted performance, the design being good,
and the method masterly. Franceschini ranks higher in fresco
than in oil painting. His works in the latter mode were not
unfrequently left unfinished, although numerous specimens
remain, the cabinet pictures being marked by much sprightliness
of invention. Among his best oil paintings of large scale is the
&ldquo;St John the Evangelist&rdquo; in the church of S. Chiara at Volterra.
One of his latest works was the fresco of the cupola of the Annunziata,
Florence, which occupied him for two years towards
1683, a production of much labour and energy. Franceschini
died of apoplexy at Volterra on the 6th of January 1689. He is
reckoned among those painters of the decline of art to whom the
general name of &ldquo;machinist&rdquo; is applied.</p>

<p>He is not to be confounded with another Franceschini of the
same class, and of rather later date, also of no small eminence
in his time&mdash;the Cavaliere Marcantonio Franceschini (1648-1729),
who was a Bolognese.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">FRANCHE-COMTÉ,<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> a province of France from 1674 to the
Revolution. It was bounded on the E. by Switzerland, on the
S. by Bresse and Bugey, on the N. by Lorraine, and on the W.
by the duchy of Burgundy and by Bassigny, embracing to the E.
of the Jura the valley of the Saône and most of that of the
Doubs. Under the Romans it corresponded to <i>Maxima Sequanorum</i>,
and after having formed part of the kingdom of Burgundy
was in the early part of the middle ages split up into the four
countships of Portois, Varais, Amons and Escuens. In the
10th century these four countships were united to form a whole,
which came to be called the countship of Burgundy, and belonged
at that time to the family of the counts of Mâcon.</p>

<p>The limits of the countship were definitely settled under
Otto William, son of Albert or Adalbert, king of Italy (&dagger;1027),
who on the death of his father-in-law, Henry (1002), tried to
seize the duchy of Burgundy, but without success. The countship,
which formed a fief dependent on the kingdom of Burgundy,
passed to Renaud I., the second son of Otto William. When
the kingdom of Burgundy was joined to the Germanic empire,
he refused to pay homage to the emperor Henry III., whose
suzerainty over him never existed except in theory. William
I., surnamed the Great or Headstrong (1059-1087), still further
added to the power of his house by marrying Etiennette, heiress
of the count of Vienne, and by acquiring from his cousin Guy,
when the latter became a monk at Cluny, the countship of Mâcon.
One of his sons, Guy, became pope, under the name of Calixtus
II. His grandson, Renaud III. (1097-1148), in his turn refused
to pay homage to the emperor Lothair, who retaliated by confiscating
his dominions and giving them to Conrad of Zähringen.
Renaud, however, succeeded in maintaining until his death his
possession of the countships of Burgundy, Vienne and Mâcon.
He left as sole heiress a daughter, Beatrix, whom his brother
William III. imprisoned, in order to make an attempt on her
inheritance; she was set free, however, by the emperor Frederick
Barbarossa, who married her in 1156.</p>

<p>On the death of Beatrix (1185) the countship of Burgundy
passed to Otto I. (1190-1200), the youngest but one of her sons,
who had to dispute its possession with Stephen, count of Auxonne,
the grandson of William III. Beatrix, the daughter and heiress
of Otto I. (1200-1231), married Otto, duke of Meran (&dagger;1234),
under whose government the inhabitants of Besançon, which
had been since the time of Frederick Barbarossa an imperial
city, formed themselves definitely into a <i>commune</i>. Alix,
daughter of Beatrix and of Otto of Meran, and heiress to the
countship of Burgundy, married Hugh of Chalon, son of John
the Ancient or the Wise (d. 1248), and a descendant of William
III. and consequently of William the Headstrong, thus bringing
the countship back into the family of its former lords. His
son Otto IV. (1279-1303) engaged in war against the bishop
of Basel, and the German king Rudolph I., who supported the
latter, entered Franche-Comté and besieged Besançon, but
without success (1289). Otto, in fulfilment of the treaties of
Ervennes and Vincennes (1291-1295) gave Jeanne, his daughter
by Mahaut of Artois, in marriage to Philip, count of Poitiers,
son of Philip the Fair. The latter took over the administration
of the countship in spite of strong opposition from the nobles
of the country, but their leader, John of Chalon-Arlay, was
compelled to make his submission. Another of Otto&rsquo;s daughters
married Charles IV., the Handsome, and both princesses,
together with their sister-in-law Margaret of Burgundy, were
concerned in the celebrated trial of the Tour de Nesle. Jeanne,
however, continued to govern her countship when Philip her
husband became king of France (Philip V., &ldquo;the Long&rdquo;).
Jeanne, their daughter and heiress, married Odo IV., duke of
Burgundy (1330-1347), and her sister Margaret became the
wife of Louis II., count of Flanders. The countship returned
to Margaret at the death of Odo IV., who was succeeded in his
duchy by his grandson Philip of Rouvre.</p>

<p>The marriage of Philip the Bold with Margaret, daughter of
Louis of Mâle, caused Franche-Comté to pass to the princes of
the ducal house of Burgundy, who kept it up till the death of
Charles the Bold (1477). On his death Louis XI. laid claim to the
government of the countship as well as of the duchy, as trustee
for the property of the princess Mary, who was closely related
to him and destined to marry the dauphin (later Charles VIII.).
French garrisons occupied the principal towns, and the lord of
Craon was appointed governor of the country. In consequence
of his severity there was a general rising, and at the same time
Mary married Maximilian, archduke of Austria, to whom her
father had formerly betrothed her (Aug. 1477). The French were
expelled from the fortified towns and Craon beaten by the people
of Dôle. Charles of Amboise, who took his place, reconquered
the province, and even Besançon submitted to the authority
of the king of France, who promised to respect its privileges.</p>

<p>On the death of Louis XI. (1483), the estates of Franche-Comté
recognized as sovereign his son Charles, who was betrothed to
the little Margaret of Burgundy, daughter of Maximilian and
Mary (d. 1482), but when Charles VIII. refused Margaret&rsquo;s
hand in order to marry Anne of Brittany there was a fresh rising,
and the French were again driven out. The treaty of Senlis
(23rd May 1483) put an end to the struggle: Charles abandoned
all his pretensions, and Maximilian was thus left in possession
of Franche-Comté, the sovereignty of which he handed on to
his son Philip and ultimately to the crown of Spain. He had,
however, constituted his daughter Margaret sovereign-governess
of Franche-Comté for life, and under the administration of this
princess (who died in 1530), as under the rule of Charles V., the
country enjoyed comparative independence, paying a &ldquo;<i>don
gratuit</i>&rdquo; of 200,000 livres every three years, and being actually
governed by the parliament of Dôle, and by governors chosen
from the nobility of the country. It was Franche-Comté which
furnished Philip II. of Spain with one of his best counsellors,
Cardinal Perrenot de Granvella.</p>

<p>In the 16th century the country was disturbed by the preaching
of Protestant doctrines, which gained adherents especially in the
district of Montbéliard, and later by the wars between France
and Spain. In 1595 the armies of Henry IV. levied contributions
on Besançon and other towns; but the people of Franche-Comté
succeeded in obtaining special terms of neutrality in order to
shelter themselves from injury from either of the parties in the
war, and enjoyed a period of calm under the government of the
infanta Isabella Clara Eugénie and the archduke Albert (1599-1621).
But the country suffered greatly from the ravages of the
Thirty Years&rsquo; War, from the presence of the army of the Condés,
which besieged Dôle, from the devastation of the troops of Gallas,
and later of those of Bernard of Saxe-Weimar. The peace of
Westphalia (1648) confirmed Spain in the possession of Franche-Comté.
In 1668 the French again entered it, and the conquest,
of which the foundations had been laid by the intrigues of the
abbot of Watteville and the French party constituted by him,
was easily accomplished by Condé and Luxemburg, Louis XIV.
directing the army in Franche-Comté for some time in person.
None the less, the country was restored to Spain at the peace
of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668), but in 1674 Louis headed another
expedition there. Besançon capitulated after a siege of twenty-seven
days, and Dôle and Salins also fell into the hands of the
invaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page932" id="page932"></a>932</span></p>

<p>In 1678 the treaty of Nijmwegen gave Franche-Comté to
France (the principality of Montbéliard remaining in the possession
of the house of Württemberg, which had acquired it by
marriage), and it was in celebration of this conquest that the
Arc de Triomphe of the Portes Saint Denis and Saint Martin
at Paris was erected. Franche-Comté became a military government
(<i>gouvernement</i>). The estates ceased to meet, and the old
&ldquo;<i>don gratuit</i>&rdquo; was replaced by a tax which became increasingly
heavy. Louis made Besançon, which Vauban fortified, into the
capital of the province, and transferred to it the parliament
and the university, the seat of which had hitherto been Dôle.
For purposes of administration, the county was divided among
the four great <i>bailliages</i> of Besançon, Dôle, Amont (chief town
Vesoul) and Aval (chief town Salins). At the Revolution were
formed from it the departments of Jura, Doubs and Haute-Saône.</p>

<p><span class="bold">FRANCHISE<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (from O. Fr. <i>franchise</i>, freedom, <i>franc</i>, free),
in English law, a royal privilege or branch of the crown&rsquo;s prerogative
subsisting in the hands of a subject. A franchise is an
incorporeal hereditament, and arises either from royal grants or
from prescription which presupposes a grant. Such franchises are
bodies corporate, the right to hold a fair, market, ferry, free
fishery, &amp;c. The term is also applied to the right of voting at

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">FRANCIA<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1450-1517), a Bolognese painter, whose real
name was Francesco Raibolini, his father being Marco di Giacomo
Raibolini, a carpenter, descended from an old and creditable
family, was born at Bologna about 1450. He was apprenticed
to a goldsmith currently named Francia, and from him probably
he got the nickname whereby he is generally known; he moreover
studied design under Marco Zoppo. The youth was thus
originally a goldsmith, and also an engraver of dies and niellos,
and in these arts he became extremely eminent. He was particularly
famed for his dies for medals; he rose to be mint-master
at Bologna, and retained that office till the end of his life. A
famous medal of Pope Julius II. as liberator of Bologna is
ascribed to his hand, but not with certainty. As a type-founder
he made for Aldus Manutius the first italic type.</p>

<p>At a mature age&mdash;having first, it appears, become acquainted
with Mantegna&mdash;he turned his attention to painting. His
earliest known picture is dated 1494 (not 1490, as ordinarily
stated). It shows so much mastery that one is compelled to
believe that Raibolini must before then have practised painting
for some few years. This work is now in the Bologna gallery,&mdash;the
&ldquo;Virgin enthroned, with Augustine and five other saints.&rdquo;
It is an oil picture, and was originally painted for the church
of S. Maria della Misericordia, at the desire of the Bentivoglio
family, the rulers of Bologna. The same patrons employed him
upon frescoes in their own palace; one of &ldquo;Judith and Holophernes&rdquo;
is especially noted, its style recalling that of Mantegna.
Francia probably studied likewise the works of Perugino; and
he became a friend and ardent admirer of Raphael, to whom he
addressed an enthusiastic sonnet. Raphael cordially responded to
the Bolognese master&rsquo;s admiration, and said, in a letter dated in
1508, that few painters or none had produced Madonnas more
beautiful, more devout, or better portrayed than those of Francia.
If we may trust Vasari&mdash;but it is difficult to suppose that he
was entirely correct&mdash;the exceeding value which Francia set on
Raphael&rsquo;s art brought him to his grave. Raphael had consigned
to Francia his famous picture of &ldquo;St Cecilia,&rdquo; destined for the
church of S. Giovanni in Monte, Bologna; and Francia, on
inspecting it, took so much to heart his own inferiority, at the
advanced age of about sixty-six, to the youthful Umbrian, that
he sickened and shortly expired on the 6th of January 1517.
A contemporary record, after attesting his pre-eminence as a
goldsmith, jeweller and painter, states that he was &ldquo;most handsome
in person and highly eloquent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Distanced though he may have been by Raphael, Francia
is rightly regarded as the greatest painter of the earlier Bolognese
school, and hardly to be surpassed as representing the art
termed &ldquo;antico-moderno,&rdquo; or of the &ldquo;quattrocento.&rdquo; It has
been well observed that his style is a medium between that of
Perugino and that of Giovanni Bellini; he has somewhat more
of spontaneous naturalism than the former, and of abstract
dignity in feature and form than the latter. The magnificent
portrait in the Louvre of a young man in black, of brooding
thoughtfulness and saddened profundity of mood, would alone
suffice to place Francia among the very great masters, if it could
with confidence be attributed to his hand, but in all probability
its real author was Franciabigio; it had erewhile passed under
the name of Raphael, of Giorgione, or of Sebastian del Piombo.
The National Gallery, London, contains two remarkably fine
specimens of Francia, once combined together as principal
picture and lunette,&mdash;the &ldquo;Virgin&rdquo; and &ldquo;Child and St Anna&rdquo;
enthroned, surrounded by saints, and (in the lunette) the &ldquo;Pietà,&rdquo;
or lamentation of angels over the dead Saviour. They come
from the Buonvisi chapel in the church of S. Frediano, Lucca,
and were among the master&rsquo;s latest paintings. Other leading
works are&mdash;in Munich, the &ldquo;Virgin&rdquo; sinking on her knees in
adoration of the Divine Infant, who is lying in a garden within
a rose trellis; in the Borghese gallery, Rome, a Peter Martyr;
in Bologna, the frescoes in the church of St Cecilia, illustrating
the life of the saint, all of them from the design of Raibolini,
but not all executed by himself. His landscape backgrounds
are of uncommon excellence. Francia had more than 200
scholars. Marcantonio Raimondi, the famous engraver, is
the most renowned of them; next to him Amico Aspertini, and
Francia&rsquo;s own son Giacomo, and his cousin Julio. Lorenzo
Costa was much associated with Francia in pictorial work.</p>

<p><span class="bold">FRANCIA, JOSÉ GASPAR RODRIGUEZ<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1757-1840),
dictator of Paraguay, was born probably about 1757. According
to one account he was of French descent; but the truth seems
to be that his father, Garcia Rodriguez Francia, was a native
of S. Paulo in Brazil, and came to Paraguay to take charge of
a plantation of black tobacco for the government. He studied
theology at the college of Cordova de Tucuman, and is said to
have been for some time a professor in that faculty; but he
afterwards turned his attention to the law, and practised in
Asuncion. Having attained a high reputation at once for
ability and integrity, he was selected for various important
offices. On the declaration of Paraguayan independence in
1811, he was appointed secretary to the national junta, and
exercised an influence on affairs greatly out of proportion to
his nominal position. When the congress or junta of 1813
changed the constitution and established a duumvirate, Dr
Francia and the Gaucho general Yegres were elected to the
office. In 1814 he secured his own election as dictator for three
years, and at the end of that period he obtained the dictatorship
for life. In the accounts which have been published of his administration
we find a strange mixture of capacity and caprice,
of far-sighted wisdom and reckless infatuation, strenuous
endeavours after a high ideal and flagrant violations of the
simplest principles of justice. He put a stop to the foreign
commerce of the country, but carefully fostered its internal
industries; was disposed to be hospitable to strangers from
other lands, and kept them prisoners for years; lived a life of
republican simplicity, and punished with Dionysian severity
the slightest want of respect. As time went on he appears to
have grown more arbitrary and despotic. Deeply imbued with
the principles of the French Revolution, he was a stern antagonist
of the church. He abolished the Inquisition, suppressed the
college of theology, did away with the tithes, and inflicted
endless indignities on the priests. He discouraged marriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page933" id="page933"></a>933</span>
both by precept and example, and left behind him several
illegitimate children. For the extravagances of his later years
the plea of insanity has been put forward. On the 20th of
September 1840 he was seized with a fit and died.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The first and fullest account of Dr Francia was given to the world
by two Swiss surgeons, Rengger and Longchamp, whom he had
detained from 1819 to 1825&mdash;<i>Essai historique sur la révolution de
Paraguay et la gouvernement dictatorial du docteur Francia</i> (Paris,
1827). Their work was almost immediately translated into English
under the title of <i>The Reign of Doctor Joseph G.R. De Francia
in Paraguay</i> (1827). About eleven years after there appeared at
London <i>Letters on Paraguay</i>, by J.P. and W.P. Robertson, two
young Scotsmen whose hopes of commercial success had been rudely
destroyed by the dictator&rsquo;s interference. The account which they
gave of his character and government was of the most unfavourable
description, and they rehearsed and emphasized their accusations in
<i>Francia&rsquo;s Reign of Terror</i> (1839) and <i>Letters on South America</i> (3 vols.,
1843). From the very pages of his detractors Thomas Carlyle
succeeded in extracting materials for a brilliant defence of the dictator
&ldquo;as a man or sovereign of iron energy and industry, of great
and severe labour.&rdquo; It appeared in the <i>Foreign Quarterly Review</i>
for 1843, and is reprinted in his <i>Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</i>.
Sir Richard F. Burton gives a graphic sketch of Francia&rsquo;s life and a
favourable notice of his character in his <i>Letters from the Battlefields
of Paraguay</i> (1870), while C.A. Washburn takes up a hostile position

<p><span class="bold">FRANCIABIGIO<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (1482-1525), Florentine painter. The name
of this artist is generally given as Mercantonio Franciabigio;
it appears, however, that his only real ascertained name was
Francesco di Cristofano; and that he was currently termed
Francia Bigio, the two appellatives being distinct. He was
born in Florence, and studied under Albertinelli for some months.
In 1505 he formed the acquaintance of Andrea del Sarto; and
after a while the two painters set up a shop in common in the
Piazza del Grano. Franciabigio paid much attention to anatomy
and perspective, and to the proportions of his figures, though
these are often too squat and puffy in form. He had a large
stock of artistic knowledge, and was at first noted for diligence.
As years went on, and he received frequent commissions for
all sorts of public painting for festive occasions, his diligence
merged in something which may rather be called workmanly
offhandedness. He was particularly proficient in fresco, and
Vasari even says that he surpassed all his contemporaries in this
method&mdash;a judgment which modern connoisseurship does not
accept. In the court of the Servites (or cloister of the Annunziata)
in Florence he painted in 1513 the &ldquo;Marriage of the Virgin,&rdquo;
as a portion of a series wherein Andrea del Sarto was chiefly
concerned. The friars having uncovered this work before it
was quite finished, Franciabigio was so incensed that, seizing
a mason&rsquo;s hammer, he struck at the head of the Virgin, and some
other heads; and the fresco, which would otherwise be his
masterpiece in that method, remains thus mutilated. At the
Scalzo, in another series of frescoes on which Andrea was likewise
employed, he executed in 1518-1519 the &ldquo;Departure of John
the Baptist for the Desert,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Meeting of the Baptist
with Jesus&rdquo;; and, at the Medici palace at Poggio a Caiano,
in 1521, the &ldquo;Triumph of Cicero.&rdquo; Various works which have
been ascribed to Raphael are now known or reasonably deemed
to be by Franciabigio. Such are the &ldquo;Madonna del Pozzo,&rdquo;
in the Uffizi Gallery; the half figure of a &ldquo;Young Man,&rdquo; in
the Louvre (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Francia</a></span>); and the famous picture in
the Fuller-Maitland collection, a &ldquo;Young Man with a Letter.&rdquo;
These two works show a close analogy in style to another in the
Pitti gallery, avowedly by Franciabigio, a &ldquo;Youth at a Window,&rdquo;
and to some others which bear this painter&rsquo;s recognized monogram.
The series of portraits, taken collectively, placed beyond dispute
the eminent and idiosyncratic genius of the master. Two other
works of his, of some celebrity, are the &ldquo;Calumny of Apelles,&rdquo;
in the Pitti, and the &ldquo;Bath of Bathsheba&rdquo; (painted in 1523),
in the Dresden gallery.</p>

&ldquo;Frenchman.&rdquo; As a Christian name it originated with St
Francis of Assisi, whose baptismal name was Giovanni, but who
was called Francesco by his father on returning from a journey
in France. The saint&rsquo;s fame made the name exceedingly popular
from his day onwards.</p>

<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS I.<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (1708-1765), Roman emperor and grand duke of
Tuscany, second son of Leopold Joseph, duke of Lorraine, and
his wife Elizabeth Charlotte, daughter of Philip, duke of Orleans,
was born on the 8th of December 1708. He was connected
with the Habsburgs through his grandmother Eleanore, daughter
of the emperor Ferdinand III., and wife of Charles Leopold of
Lorraine. The emperor Charles VI. favoured the family, who,
besides being his cousins, had served the house of Austria with
distinction. He had designed to marry his daughter Maria
Theresa to Clement, the elder brother of Francis. On the death
of Clement he adopted the younger brother as her husband.
Francis was brought up at Vienna with Maria Theresa on the
understanding that they were to be married, and a real affection
arose between them. At the age of fifteen, when he was brought
to Vienna, he was established in the Silesian duchy of Teschen,
which had been mediatized and granted to his father by the
emperor in 1722. He succeeded his father as duke of Lorraine
in 1729, but the emperor, at the end of the Polish War of Succession,
desiring to compensate his candidate Stanislaus Leszczynski
for the loss of his crown in 1735, persuaded Francis to exchange
Lorraine for the reversion of the grand duchy of Tuscany. On
the 12th of February 1736 he was married to Maria Theresa,
and they went for a short time to Florence, when he succeeded
to the grand duchy in 1737 on the death of John Gaston, the
last of the ruling house of Medici. His wife secured his election
to the Empire on the 13th of September 1745, in succession to
Charles VII., and she made him co-regent of her hereditary
dominions. Francis was well content to leave the reality of
power to his able wife. He had a natural fund of good sense
and some business capacity, and was a useful assistant to Maria
Theresa in the laborious task of governing the complicated
Austrian dominions, but his functions appear to have been of a
purely secretarial character. He died suddenly in his carriage
while returning from the opera at Innsbruck on the 18th of
August 1765.</p>

<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS II.<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> (1768-1835), the last Roman emperor, and, as
Francis I., first emperor of Austria, was the son of Leopold II.,
grand-duke of Tuscany, afterwards emperor, and of his wife
Maria Louisa, daughter of Charles III. of Spain. He was born
at Florence on the 12th of February 1768. In 1784 he was
brought to Vienna to complete his education under the eye of
his uncle the emperor Joseph II., who was childless. Joseph
was repelled by the frigid and retiring character of his nephew,
and is said to have treated him with an impatient contempt
which confirmed his natural timidity; but after the marriage
of Francis to Elizabeth of Württemberg (1788) their relations
improved. At the close of his uncle&rsquo;s reign he saw some service
in the ill-conducted war with Turkey, and kept a careful diary
of his experiences. The death of his wife in childbirth on the
18th of February 1790 was followed by the death of his uncle
on the 20th; and Francis acted as regent with Prince Kaunitz
until his father came from Florence. On the 19th of September
he married his first cousin Maria Theresa, daughter of Ferdinand,
king of Naples, by whom he was the father of his successor
Ferdinand I., of Maria Louisa, wife of Napoleon, and of the
archduke Francis, father of the emperor Francis Joseph. After
her death (1807) he married Maria Ludovica Beatrix of Este
(1808), and when she died he made a fourth marriage with
Carolina Augusta of Bavaria (1816).</p>

<p>He succeeded to the Austrian dominions and the empire on
the death of his father on the 1st of March 1792. The position
was a trying one for a young prince twenty-four years of age.
The dominions of the house of Austria, widely scattered in the
Low Countries, Germany and Italy, were exposed to the attacks
of the French revolutionary governments and of Napoleon. He
was dragged into all the coalitions against France, and in the
early days of his reign he had to guard against the ambition of
Prussia, and the aggressions of Russia in Poland and Turkey.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page934" id="page934"></a>934</span>
For long he had no adviser save such diplomatists as Prince
Kaunitz and Thugut, who had been trained in the old Austrian
diplomacy. His own best quality was an invincible patience
supported by reliance on the loyalty of his subjects, and a sense
of his duty to the state. (For the general events of this reign till
1815 see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Europe</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Austria</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Napoleon</a></span>,
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">French Revolutionary Wars</a></span>, &amp;c.) The emperor&rsquo;s firmness averted what would have
been an irreparable loss of position. Seeing that the Empire
was in the last stage of dissolution, and that, even were it to
survive, it would pass from the house of Habsburg to that of
Bonaparte, he in 1804 assumed the title of hereditary emperor
of Austria. The object of this prudent measure was double.
In the first place, he guarded against the danger that his house
should sink to a lower rank than the Russian or the French.
In the second place, he gave some semblance of unity to his complex
dominions in Germany, Bohemia, Hungary and Italy,
by providing a common title for the supreme ruler. His action
was justified when, in 1806, the establishment of the Confederation
of the Rhine forced him to abdicate the empty title of Holy
Roman emperor.</p>

<p>In 1805 he made an important change in the working of his
administration. He had hitherto been assisted by a cabinet
minister who was in direct relation with all the &ldquo;chanceries&rdquo;
and boards which formed the executive government, and who
acted as the channel of communication between them and the
emperor, and was in fact a prime minister. In 1805 Napoleon
insisted on the removal of Count Colloredo, who held the post.
From that time forward the emperor Francis acted as his own
prime minister, superintending every detail of his administration.
In foreign affairs after 1809 he reposed full confidence in Prince
Metternich. But Metternich himself declared at the close of his
life that he had sometimes held Europe in the palm of his hand,
but never Austria. Francis was sole master, and is entitled to
whatever praise is due to his government. It follows that he
must bear the blame for its errors. The history of the Austrian
empire under his rule and since his death bears testimony to
both his merits and his limitations. His indomitable patience
and loyalty to his inherited task enabled him to triumph over
Napoleon. By consenting to the marriage of his daughter,
Marie Louise, to Napoleon in 1810, he gained a respite which he
turned to good account. By following the guidance of Metternich
in foreign affairs he was able to intervene with decisive effect in
1813. The settlement of Europe in 1815 left Austria stronger
and more compact than she had been in 1792, and that this
was the case was largely due to the emperor.</p>

<p>During the twenty years which preceded his death in 1835,
Francis continued to oppose the revolutionary spirit. He had
none of the mystical tendencies of the tsar Alexander I., and only
adhered to the half fantastic Holy Alliance of 1815 out of pure
politeness. But he was wholly in sympathy with the policy of
&ldquo;repression&rdquo; which came, in popular view, to be identified with
the Holy Alliance; and though Metternich was primarily responsible
for the part played by Austria in the &ldquo;policing&rdquo; of
Europe, Francis cannot but be held personally responsible for the
cruel and impolitic severities, associated especially with the
sinister name of the fortress prison of the Spielberg, which made
so many martyrs to freedom. It is not surprising that Francis
was denounced by Liberals throughout Europe as a tyrant and an
obscurantist. But though at home, as abroad, he met all suggestions
of innovation by a steady refusal to depart from old ways,
he was always popular among the mass of his subjects, who
called him &ldquo;our good Kaiser Franz.&rdquo; In truth, if in the spirit
of the traditional <i>Landesvater</i> he chastised his disobedient children
mercilessly, he was essentially a well-meaning ruler who forwarded
the material and moral good of his subjects according
to his lights. But he held that, by the will of God, the whole
sovereign authority resided in his person, and could not be
shared with others without a dereliction of duty on his part and
disastrous consequences; and his capital error as a ruler of
Austria was that he persisted in maintaining a system of administration
which depended upon the indefatigable industry of a
single man, and was entirely outgrown by the modern development
of his subjects. Before his death, government in Austria
was almost choked, and it broke down under a successor who
had not his capacity for work. Like his ancestor Philip II. of
Spain, Francis carried caution, and a disposition to sleep upon
every possible proposal, to a great length. He died on the 2nd
of March 1835.</p>

<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS I.<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (1494-1547), king of France, son of Charles of
Valois, count of Angoulême, and Louise of Savoy, was born at
Cognac on the 12th of September 1494. The count of Angoulême,
who was the great-grandson of King Charles V., died in 1496,
and Louise watched over her son with passionate tenderness.
On the accession of Louis XII. in 1498, Francis became heir-presumptive.
Louis invested him with the duchy of Valois,
and gave him as tutor Marshal de Gié, and, after Gié&rsquo;s disgrace
in 1503, the sieur de Boisy, Artus Gouffier. François de Rochefort,
abbot of St Mesmin, instructed Francis and his sister
Marguerite in Latin and history; Louise herself taught them
Italian and Spanish; and the library of the château at Amboise
was well stocked with romances of the Round Table, which
exalted the lad&rsquo;s imagination. Francis showed an even greater
love for violent exercises, such as hunting, which was his ruling
passion, and tennis, and for tournaments, masquerades and
amusements of all kinds. His earliest gallantries are described by
his sister in the 25th and 42nd stories of the <i>Heptameron</i>. In
1507 Francis was betrothed to Claude, the daughter of Louis XII.,
and in 1508 he came to court. In 1512 he gained his first military
experience in Guienne, and in the following year he commanded
the army of Picardy. He married Claude on the 18th of May
1514, and succeeded Louis XII. on the 1st of January 1515.
Of noble bearing, and, in spite of a very long and large nose,
extremely handsome, he was a sturdy and valiant knight, affable,
courteous, a brilliant talker and a facile poet. He had a sprightly
wit, some delicacy of feeling, and some generous impulses which
made him amiable. These brilliant qualities, however, were all
on the surface. At bottom the man was frivolous, profoundly
selfish, unstable, and utterly incapable of consistency or application.
The ambassadors remarked his negligence, and his
ministers complained of it. Hunting, tennis, jewelry and his
gallantry were the chief preoccupations of his life.</p>

<p>His character was at once authoritative and weak. He was
determined to be master and to decide everything himself, but
he allowed himself to be dominated and easily persuaded.
Favourites, too, without governing entirely for him, played
an important part in his reign. His capricious humour elevated
and deposed them with the same disconcerting suddenness.
In the early years of his reign the conduct of affairs was chiefly
in the hands of Louise of Savoy, Chancellor Antoine Duprat,
Secretary Florimond Robertet, and the two Gouffiers, Boisy and
Bonnivet. The royal favour then elevated Anne de Montmorency
and Philippe de Chabot, and in the last years of the reign Marshal
d&rsquo;Annebaud and Cardinal de Tournon. Women too had always a
great influence over Francis&mdash;his sister, Marguerite d&rsquo;Angoulême,
and his mistresses. Whatever the number of these, he had only
two titular mistresses&mdash;at the beginning of the reign Françoise
de Châteaubriant, and from about 1526 to his death Anne de
Pisseleu, whom he created duchesse d&rsquo;Étampes and who entirely
dominated him. It has not been proved that he was the lover of
Diane de Poitiers, nor does the story of &ldquo;La belle Ferronnière&rdquo;
appear to rest on any historical foundation.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>Circumstances alone gave a homogeneous character to the
foreign policy of Francis. The struggle against the emperor
Charles V. filled the greater part of the reign. In reality, the
policy of Francis, save for some flashes of sagacity, was irresolute
and vacillating. Attracted at first by Italy, dreaming of fair
feats of prowess, he led the triumphal Marignano expedition,
which gained him reputation as a knightly king and as the most
powerful prince in Europe. In 1519, in spite of wise counsels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page935" id="page935"></a>935</span>
he stood candidate for the imperial crown. The election of
Charles V. caused an inevitable rivalry between the two monarchs
which accentuated still further the light and chivalrous temper of
the king and the cold and politic character of the emperor.
Francis&rsquo;s personal intervention in this struggle was seldom
happy. He did not succeed in gaining the support of Henry VIII.
of England at the interview of the Field of the Cloth of Gold in
1520; his want of tact goaded the Constable de Bourbon to
extreme measures in 1522-1523; and in the Italian campaign
of 1525 he proved himself a mediocre, vacillating and foolhardy
leader, and by his blundering led the army to the disaster of
Pavia (the 25th of February 1525), where, however, he fought
with great bravery. &ldquo;Of all things,&rdquo; he wrote to his mother
after the defeat, &ldquo;nothing remains to me but honour and life,
which is safe&rdquo;&mdash;the authentic version of the legendary phrase
&ldquo;All is lost save honour.&rdquo; He strove to play the part of royal
captive heroically, but the prison life galled him. He fell ill at
Madrid and was on the point of death. For a moment he thought
of abdicating rather than of ceding Burgundy. But this was too
great a demand upon his fortitude, and he finally yielded and
signed the treaty of Madrid, after having drawn up a secret protest.
After Madrid he wavered unceasingly between two courses, either
that of continuing hostilities, or the policy favoured by Montmorency
of peace and understanding with the emperor. At times he
had the sagacity to recognize the utility of alliances, as was shown
by those he concluded with the Porte and with the Protestant
princes of Germany. But he could never pledge himself frankly
in one sense or the other, and this vacillation prevented him
from attaining any decisive results. At his death, however,
France was in possession of Savoy and Piedmont.</p>

<p>In his religious policy Francis showed the same instability.
Drawn between various influences, that of Marguerite
d&rsquo;Angoulême, the du Bellays, and the duchesse d&rsquo;Étampes,
who was in favour of the Reformation or at least of toleration,
and the contrary influence of the uncompromising Catholics,
Duprat, and then Montmorency and de Tournon, he gave
pledges successively to both parties. In the first years of the
reign, following the counsels of Marguerite, he protected Jacques
Lefèvre of Etaples and Louis de Berquin, and showed some
favour to the new doctrines. But the violence of the Reformers
threw him into the arms of the opposite party. The affair of the
Placards in 1534 irritated him beyond measure, and determined
him to adopt a policy of severity. From that time, in spite of
occasional indulgences shown to the Reformers, due to his desire
to conciliate the Protestant powers, Francis gave a free hand
to the party of repression, of which the most active and most
pitiless member was Cardinal de Tournon; and the end of the
reign was sullied by the massacre of the Waldenses (1545).</p>

<p>Francis introduced new methods into government. In his
reign the monarchical authority became more imperious and
more absolute. His was the government &ldquo;<i>du bon plaisir</i>.&rdquo; By
the unusual development he gave to the court he converted the
nobility into a brilliant household of dependants. The Concordat
brought the clergy into subjection, and enabled him to distribute
benefices at his pleasure among the most docile of his courtiers.
He governed in the midst of a group of favourites, who formed
the <i>conseil des affaires</i>. The states-general did not meet, and the
remonstrances of the parlement were scarcely tolerated. By
centralizing the financial administration by the creation of the
<i>Trésor de l&rsquo;Épargne</i>, and by developing the military establishments,
Francis still further strengthened the royal power. His
government had the vices of his foreign policy. It was uncertain,
irregular and disorderly. The finances were squandered in
gratifying the king&rsquo;s unbridled prodigality, and the treasury
was drained by his luxurious habits, by the innumerable gifts and
pensions he distributed among his mistresses and courtiers, by
his war expenses and by his magnificent buildings. His government,
too, weighed heavily upon the people, and the king was
less popular than is sometimes imagined.</p>

<p>Francis owes the greater measure of his glory to the artists and
men of letters who vied in celebrating his praises. He was
pre-eminently the king of the Renaissance. Of a quick and
cultivated intelligence, he had a sincere love of letters and art.
He holds a high place in the history of humanism by the foundation
of the Collège de France; he did not found an actual college,
but after much hesitation instituted in 1530, at the instance of
Guillaume Budé (Budaeus), <i>Lecteurs royaux</i>, who in spite of the
opposition of the Sorbonne were granted full liberty to teach
Hebrew, Greek, Latin, mathematics, &amp;c. The humanists
Budé, Jacques Colin and Pierre Duchâtel were the king&rsquo;s
intimates, and Clément Marot was his favourite poet. Francis
sent to Italy for artists and for works of art, but he protected
his own countrymen also. Here, too, he showed his customary
indecision, wavering between the two schools. At his court he
installed Benvenuto Cellini, Francesco Primaticcio and Rosso
del Rosso, but in the buildings at Chambord, St Germain,
Villers-Cotterets and Fontainebleau the French tradition
triumphed over the Italian.</p>

<p>Francis died on the 31st of March 1547, of a disease of the
urinary ducts according to some accounts, of syphilis according
to others. By his first wife Claude (d. 1524) he had three sons
and four daughters: Louise, who died in infancy; Charlotte,
who died at the age of eight; Francis (d. 1536); Henry, who
came to the throne as Henry II.; Madeleine, who became
queen of Scotland; Charles (d. 1545); and Margaret, duchess
of Savoy. In 1530 he married Eleanor, the sister of the emperor
Charles V.</p>

<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS II.<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> (1544-1560), king of France, eldest son of Henry
II. and of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, was born at Fontainebleau on
the 19th of January 1544. He married the famous Mary Stuart,
daughter of James V. of Scotland, on the 25th of April 1558, and
ascended the French throne on the 10th of July 1559. During
his short reign the young king, a sickly youth and of feeble
understanding, was the mere tool of his uncles Francis, duke of
Guise, and Charles, cardinal of Lorraine, into whose hands he
virtually delivered the reins of government. The exclusiveness
with which they were favoured, and their high-handed proceedings,
awakened the resentment of the princes of the blood,
Anthony king of Navarre and Louis prince of Condé, who gave
their countenance to a conspiracy (conspiracy of Amboise)
with the Protestants against the house of Guise. It was, however,
discovered shortly before the time fixed for its execution in
March 1560, and an ambush having been prepared, most of the
conspirators were either killed or taken prisoners. Its leadership
and organization had been entrusted to Godfrey de Barri, lord of
la Renaudie (d. 1560); and the prince of Condé, who was not
present, disavowed all connexion with the plot. The duke of
Guise was now named lieutenant-general of the kingdom, but
his Catholic leanings were somewhat held in check by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page936" id="page936"></a>936</span>
chancellor Michel de l&rsquo;Hôpital, through whose mediation the edict
of Romorantin, providing that all cases of heresy should be decided
by the bishops, was passed in May 1560, in opposition to a proposal
to introduce the Inquisition. At a meeting of the states-general
held at Orleans in the December following, the prince of
Condé, after being arrested, was condemned to death, and extreme
measures were being enacted against the Huguenots;
but the deliberations of the Assembly were broken off, and the
prince was saved from execution, by the king&rsquo;s somewhat sudden
death, on the 5th of the month, from an abscess in the ear.</p>

<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS I.<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (1777-1830), king of the Two Sicilies, was the son
of Ferdinand IV. (I.) and Maria Carolina of Austria. He married
Clementina, daughter of the emperor Leopold II. of Austria,
in 1796, and at her death Isabella, daughter of Charles IV. of
Spain. After the Bourbon family fled from Naples to Sicily
in 1806, and Lord William Bentinck, the British resident, had
established a constitution and deprived Ferdinand IV. of all
power, Francis was appointed regent (1812). On the fall of
Napoleon his father returned to Naples and suppressed the
Sicilian constitution and autonomy, incorporating his two
kingdoms into that of the Two Sicilies (1816); Francis then
assumed the revived title of duke of Calabria. While still heir-apparent
he professed liberal ideas, and on the outbreak of the
revolution of 1820 he accepted the regency apparently in a
friendly spirit towards the new constitution. But he was
playing a double game and proved to be the accomplice of his
father&rsquo;s treachery. On succeeding to the throne in 1825 he cast
aside the mask of liberalism and showed himself as reactionary
as his father. He took little part in the government, which he
left in the hands of favourites and police officials, and lived
with his mistresses, surrounded by soldiers, ever in dread of
assassination. During his reign the only revolutionary movement
was the outbreak on the Cilento (1828), savagely repressed
by the marquis Delcarretto, an ex-Liberal turned reactionary.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS II.<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span> (1836-1894), king of the Two Sicilies, son of
Ferdinand II. and Maria Cristina of Savoy, was the last of the
Bourbon kings of Naples. His education had been much
neglected and he proved a man of weak character, greatly
influenced by his stepmother Maria Theresa of Austria, by the
priests, and by the <i>Camarilla</i>, or reactionary court set. He
ascended the throne on the death of his father (22nd of May
1859). As prime minister he at once appointed Carlo Filangieri,
who, realizing the importance of the Franco-Piedmontese
victories in Lombardy, advised Francis to accept the alliance
with Piedmont proposed by Cavour. On the 7th of June a part
of the Swiss Guard mutinied, and while the king mollified them
by promising to redress their grievances, General Nunziante
collected other troops, who surrounded the mutineers and shot
them down. The incident resulted in the disbanding of the
whole Swiss Guard, the strongest bulwark of the dynasty.
Cavour again proposed an alliance to divide the papal states
between Piedmont and Naples, the province of Rome excepted,
but Francis rejected an idea which to him savoured of sacrilege.
Filangieri strongly advocated a constitution as the only measure
which might save the dynasty, and on the king&rsquo;s refusal he
resigned. Meanwhile the revolutionary parties were conspiring
for the overthrow of the Bourbons in Calabria and Sicily, and
Garibaldi was preparing for a raid in the south. A conspiracy
in Sicily was discovered and the plotters punished with brutal
severity, but Rosalino Pilo and Francesco Crispi had organized
the movement, and when Garibaldi landed at Marsala (May
1860) he conquered the island with astonishing ease. These
events at last frightened Francis into granting a constitution,
but its promulgation was followed by disorders in Naples and
the resignation of ministers, and Liborio Romano became head
of the government. The disintegration of the army and navy
proceeded apace, and Cavour sent a Piedmontese squadron
carrying troops on board to watch events. Garibaldi, who had
crossed the straits of Messina, was advancing northwards and
was everywhere received by the people as a liberator. Francis,
after long hesitations and even an appeal to Garibaldi himself,
left Naples (6th of September) with his wife Maria Sophia, the
court, the diplomatic corps (the French and English ministers
excepted), and went by sea to Gaeta, where a large part of
the army was concentrated. The next day Garibaldi entered
Naples, was enthusiastically welcomed, and formed a provisional
government. King Victor Emmanuel had decided on the invasion
of the papal states, and after occupying Romagna and
the Marche entered the Neapolitan kingdom. Garibaldi&rsquo;s troops
defeated the Neapolitan royalists on the Volturno (1st and 2nd
of October), while the Piedmontese captured Capua. Only
Gaeta, Messina, and Civitella del Tronto still held out, and the
siege of the former by the Piedmontese began on the 6th of
November 1860. Both Francis and Maria Sophia behaved with
great coolness and courage, and even when the French fleet,
whose presence had hitherto prevented an attack by sea, was
withdrawn, they still resisted; it was not until the 12th of
February 1861 that the fortress capitulated. Thus the kingdom
of Naples was incorporated in that of Italy, and the royal pair
from that time forth led a wandering life in Austria, France and
Bavaria. Francis died on the 27th of December 1894 at Arco
in Tirol. His widow survived him.</p>

<p>Francis II. was weak-minded, stupid and vacillating, but,
although his short reign was stained with some cruel massacres
and persecutions, he was less of a tyrant than his father. The
courage and dignity he displayed during his reverses inspired
pity and respect. But the fact that he protected brigandage
in his former dominions and countenanced the most abominable
crimes in the name of legitimism greatly diminished the sympathy
which was felt for the fallen monarch.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS IV.<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (1779-1846) duke of Modena, was the son of the
archduke Ferdinand, Austrian governor of Lombardy, who
acquired the duchy of Modena through his wife Marie Beatrice,
heiress of the house of Este as well as of many fiefs of the Malaspina,
Pio da Carpi, Pico della Mirandola, Cibò, and other families.
At the time of the French invasion (1796) Francis was sent to
Vienna to be educated, and in 1809 was appointed governor of
Galicia. Later he went to Sardinia, where the exiled King Victor
Emmanuel I. and his wife Maria Theresa were living in retirement.
The latter arranged a marriage between her daughter Marie
Beatrice and Francis, and a secret family compact was made
whereby if the king and his two brothers died without male
issue, the Salic law would be changed so that Francis should
succeed to the kingdom instead of Charles Albert of Carignano
(N. Bianchi, <i>Storia della diplomazia europea in Italia</i>, i. 42-43).
On the fall of Napoleon in 1814 Francis received the duchy of
Modena, including Massa-Carrara and Lunigiana; his mother&rsquo;s
advice was &ldquo;to be above the law ... never to forgive the
Republicans of 1796, nor to listen to the complaints of his subjects,
whom nothing satisfies; the poorer they are the quieter they
are&rdquo; (Silingardi, &ldquo;Ciro Menotti,&rdquo; in <i>Rivista europea</i>, Florence,
1880).</p>

<p>The duke was well received at Modena; inordinately ambitious,
strong-willed, immensely rich, avaricious but not unintelligent,
he soon proved one of the most reactionary despots in Italy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page937" id="page937"></a>937</span>
He still hoped to acquire either Piedmont or some other part
of northern Italy, and he was in touch with the Sanfedisti and
the Concistoro, reactionary Catholic associations opposed to
the Carbonari, but not always friendly to Austria. Against the
Carbonari and other Liberals he issued the severest edicts, and
although there was no revolt at Modena in 1821 as in Piedmont
and Naples, he immediately instituted judicial proceedings
against the supposed conspirators. Some 350 persons were
arrested and tortured, 56 being condemned to death (only a
few of them were executed) and 237 to imprisonment; a large
number, however, escaped, including Antonio Panizzi (afterwards
director of the British Museum). The ferocious police official
Besini who conducted the trials was afterwards murdered.
The duke actually proposed to Prince Metternich, the Austrian
chancellor, an agreement whereby the various Italian rulers
were to arrest every Liberal in the country on a certain day, but
the project fell through owing to opposition from the courts of
Florence and Rome. At the congress of Verona Metternich
made another attempt to secure the Piedmontese succession
for Francis, but without success. The duke became ever more
despotic; Modena swarmed with spies and informers, education
was hampered, feudalism strengthened; for the duke hoped
to consolidate his power by means of the nobility, and the least
expression of liberalism, or even failure to denounce a Carbonaro,
involved arrest and imprisonment. But strange to say, in 1830
we find Francis actually coquetting with revolution. Having
lost all hope of acquiring the Piedmontese throne, he entered
into negotiations with the French Orleanist party with a view
to obtaining its support in his plans for extending his dominions.
He was thus brought into touch with Ciro Menotti (1798-1831)
and the Modenese Liberals; what the nature of the connexion
was is still obscure, but it was certainly short-lived and merely
served to betray the Carbonari. As soon as Francis learned that
a conspiracy was on foot to gain possession of the town, he had
Menotti and several other conspirators arrested on the night
of the 3rd of February 1831, and sent the famous message
to the governor of Reggio: &ldquo;The conspirators are in my hands;
send me the hangman&rdquo; (there is some doubt as to the authenticity
of the actual words). But the revolt broke out in other
parts of the duchy and in Romagna, and Francis retired to
Mantua with Menotti. A provisional government was formed
at Modena which proclaimed that &ldquo;Italy is one,&rdquo; but the duke
returned a few weeks later with Austrian troops, and resistance
was easily quelled. Then the political trials began; Menotti
and two others were executed, and hundreds condemned to
imprisonment. The population was now officially divided into
four classes, viz. &ldquo;very loyal, loyal, less loyal, and disloyal,&rdquo;
and the reaction became worse than ever, the duke interfering
in the minutest details of administration, such as hospitals,
schools, and roads. New methods of procedure were introduced
to deal with political trials, but the ministerial cabal by which
the country was administered intrigued and squabbled to such an
extent that it had to be dismissed.</p>

<p>On the 20th of February 1846 Francis died. Although he had
many domestic virtues and charming manners, was charitable in
times of famine, and was certainly the ablest of the Italian despots,
Liberalism was in his eyes the most heinous of crimes, and his
reign is one long record of barbarous persecution.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS V.<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (1819-1875), duke of Modena, son of Francis IV.,
succeeded his father in 1846. Although less cruel and also less
intelligent than his father, he had an equally high opinion of
his own authority. His reign began with disturbances at Fivizzano
and Pontremoli, which Tuscany surrendered to him according
to treaty but against the wishes of the inhabitants (1847),
and at Massa and Carrara, where the troops shot down the
people. Feeling his position insecure, the duke asked for and
obtained an Austrian garrison, but on the outbreak of revolution
throughout Italy and at Vienna in 1848, further disorders
occurred in the duchy, and on the 20th of March he fled with his
family to Mantua. A provisional government was formed, and
volunteers were raised who fought with the Piedmontese against
Austria. But after the Piedmontese defeat Francis returned to
Modena, with Austrian assistance, in August and conferred many
appointments on Austrian officers. Like his father, he interfered
in the minutest details of administration, and instituted proceedings
against all who were suspected of Liberalism. Not content
with the severity of his judges, he overrode their sentences in
favour of harsher punishments. The disturbances at Carrara
were ruthlessly suppressed, and the prisons filled with politicals.
In 1859 numbers of young Modenese fled across the frontier to join
the Piedmontese army, as war with Austria seemed imminent;
and after the Austrian defeat at Magenta the duke left Modena to
lead his army in person against the Piedmontese, taking with him
the contents of the state treasury and many valuable books,
pictures, coins, tapestries and furniture from the palace. The
events of 1859-1860 made his return impossible; and after a short
spell of provisional government the duchy was united to Italy.

<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS OF ASSISI, ST.<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (1181 or 1182-1226), founder of
the Franciscans (<i>q.v.</i>), was born in 1181 or 1182 at Assisi, one
of the independent municipal towns of Umbria. He came
from the upper middle class, his father, named Pietro Bernardone,
being one of the larger merchants of the city. Bernardone&rsquo;s
commercial enterprises made him travel abroad, and it was
from the fact that the father was in France at the time of his
son&rsquo;s birth that the latter was called Francesco. His education
appears to have been of the slightest, even for those days. It
is difficult to decide whether words of the early biographers
imply that his youth was not free from irregularities; in any
case, he was the recognized leader of the young men of the town
in their revels; he was, however, always conspicuous for his
charity to the poor. When he was twenty (1201) the neighbouring
and rival city of Perugia attempted to restore by force of
arms the nobles who had been expelled from Assisi by the
burghers and the populace, and Francis took part in the battle
fought in the plain that lies between the two cities; the men
of Assisi were defeated and Francis was among the prisoners.
He spent a year in prison at Perugia, and when peace was made
at the end of 1202 he returned to Assisi and recommenced his
old life.</p>

<p>Soon a serious and prolonged illness fell upon him, during
which he entered into himself and became dissatisfied with his
way of life. On his recovery he set out on a military expedition,
but at the end of the first day&rsquo;s march he fell ill, and had to stay
at Spoleto and return to Assisi. This disappointment brought
on again the spiritual crisis he had experienced in his illness, and
for a considerable time the conflict went on within him. One
day he gave a banquet to his friends, and after it they sallied
forth with torches, singing through the streets, Francis being
crowned with garlands as the king of the revellers; after a time
they missed him, and on retracing their steps they found him in
a trance or reverie, a permanently altered man. He devoted
himself to solitude, prayer and the service of the poor, and
before long went on a pilgrimage to Rome. Finding the usual
crowd of beggars before St Peter&rsquo;s, he exchanged his clothes
with one of them, and experienced an overpowering joy in
spending the day begging among the rest. The determining
episode of his life followed soon after his return to Assisi; as
he was riding he met a leper who begged an alms; Francis had
always had a special horror of lepers, and turning his face he
rode on; but immediately an heroic act of self-conquest was
wrought in him; returning he alighted, gave the leper all the
money he had about him, and kissed his hand. From that day he
gave himself up to the service of the lepers and the hospitals.
To the confusion of his father and brothers he went about
dressed in rags, so that his old companions pelted him with mud.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page938" id="page938"></a>938</span>
Things soon came to a climax with his father: in consequence
of his profuse alms to the poor and to the restoration of the
ruined church of St Damian, his father feared his property would
be dissipated, so he took Francis before the bishop of Assisi
to have him legally disinherited; but without waiting for the
documents to be drawn up, Francis cast off his clothes and gave
them back to his father, declaring that now he had better reason
to say &ldquo;Our Father which art in heaven,&rdquo; and having received
a cloak from the bishop, he went off into the woods of Mount
Subasio singing a French song; some brigands accosted him
and he told them he was the herald of the great king (1206).</p>

<p>The next three years he spent in the neighbourhood of Assisi
in abject poverty and want, ministering to the lepers and the
outcasts of society. It was now that he began to frequent the
ruined little chapel of St Mary of the Angels, known as the
Portiuncula, where much of his time was passed in prayer.
One day while Mass was being said therein, the words of the
Gospel came to Francis as a call: &ldquo;Everywhere on your road
preach and say&mdash;The kingdom of God is at hand. Cure the sick,
raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, drive out devils. Freely have
you received, freely give. Carry neither gold nor silver nor
money in your girdles, nor bag, nor two coats, nor sandals,
nor staff, for the workman is worthy of his hire&rdquo; (Matt. x. 7-10).
He at once felt that this was his vocation, and the next day,
layman as he was, he went up to Assisi and began to preach to
the poor (1209). Disciples joined him, and when they were
twelve in number Francis said: &ldquo;Let us go to our Mother,
the holy Roman Church, and tell the pope what the Lord has
begun to do through us, and carry it out with his sanction.&rdquo;
They obtained the sanction of Innocent III., and returning
to Assisi they gave themselves up to their life of apostolic
preaching and work among the poor.</p>

<p>The character and development of the order are traced in the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Franciscans</a></span>; here the story of Francis&rsquo;s own life and
the portrayal of his personality will be attempted. To delineate
in a few words the character of the Poverello of Assisi is indeed
a difficult task. There is such a many-sided richness, such a
tenderness, such a poetry, such an originality, such a distinction
revealed by the innumerable anecdotes in the memoirs of his
disciples, that his personality is brought home to us as one of
the most lovable and one of the strongest of men. It is probably
true to say that no one has ever set himself so seriously to imitate
the life of Christ and to carry out so literally Christ&rsquo;s work in
Christ&rsquo;s own way. This was the secret of his love of poverty as
manifested in the following beautiful prayer which he addressed
to our Lord: &ldquo;Poverty was in the crib and like a faithful squire
she kept herself armed in the great combat Thou didst wage for
our redemption. During Thy passion she alone did not forsake
Thee. Mary Thy Mother stopped at the foot of the Cross, but
poverty mounted it with Thee and clasped Thee in her embrace
unto the end; and when Thou wast dying of thirst, as a watchful
spouse she prepared for Thee the gall. Thou didst expire in the
ardour of her embraces, nor did she leave Thee when dead, O
Lord Jesus, for she allowed not Thy body to rest elsewhere than
in a borrowed grave. O poorest Jesus, the grace I beg of Thee
is to bestow on me the treasure of the highest poverty. Grant
that the distinctive mark of our Order may be never to possess
anything as its own under the sun for the glory of Thy name,
and to have no other patrimony than begging&rdquo; (in the <i>Legenda
3 Soc.</i>). This enthusiastic love of poverty is certainly the keynote
of St Francis&rsquo;s spirit; and so one of his disciples in an allegorical
poem (translated into English as <i>The Lady of Poverty</i> by
Montgomery Carmichael, 1901), and Giotto in one of the frescoes
at Assisi, celebrated the &ldquo;holy nuptials of Francis with Lady
Poverty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another striking feature of Francis&rsquo;s character was his constant
joyousness; it was a precept in his rule, and one that he enforced
strictly, that his friars should be always rejoicing in the Lord.
He retained through life his early love of song, and during his
last illness he passed much of his time in singing. His love of
nature, animate and inanimate, was very keen and manifested
itself in ways that appear somewhat naïve. His preaching to
the birds is a favourite representation of St Francis in art. All
creatures he called his &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; or &ldquo;sisters&rdquo;&mdash;the chief
example is the poem of the &ldquo;Praises of the Creatures,&rdquo; wherein
&ldquo;brother Sun,&rdquo; &ldquo;sister Moon,&rdquo; &ldquo;brother Wind,&rdquo; and &ldquo;sister
Water&rdquo; are called on to praise God. In his last illness he was
cauterized, and on seeing the burning iron he addressed &ldquo;brother
Fire,&rdquo; reminding him how he had always loved him and asking
him to deal kindly with him. It would be an anachronism to
think of Francis as a philanthropist or a &ldquo;social worker&rdquo; or a
revivalist preacher, though he fulfilled the best functions of all
these. Before everything he was an ascetic and a mystic&mdash;an
ascetic who, though gentle to others, wore out his body by
self-denial, so much so that when he came to die he begged pardon
of &ldquo;brother Ass the body&rdquo; for having unduly ill treated it: a
mystic irradiated with the love of God, endowed in an extraordinary
degree with the spirit of prayer, and pouring forth his
heart by the hour in the tenderest affections to God and our Lord.
St Francis was a deacon but not a priest.</p>

<p>From the return of Francis and his eleven companions from
Rome to Assisi in 1209 or 1210, their work prospered in a wonderful
manner. The effect of their preaching, and their example and
their work among the poor, made itself felt throughout Umbria
and brought about a great religious revival. Great numbers came
to join the new order which responded so admirably to the needs
of the time. In 1212 Francis invested St Clara (<i>q.v.</i>) with the
Franciscan habit, and so instituted the &ldquo;Second Order,&rdquo; that of
the nuns. As the friars became more and more numerous their
missionary labours extended wider and wider, spreading first over
Italy, and then to other countries. Francis himself set out,
probably in 1212, for the Holy Land to preach the Gospel to the
Saracens, but he was shipwrecked and had to return. A year or
two later he went into Spain to preach to the Moors, but had
again to return without accomplishing his object (1215 probably).
After another period of preaching in Italy and watching over
the development of the order, Francis once again set out for
the East (1219). This time he was successful; he made his way
to Egypt, where the crusaders were besieging Damietta, got
himself taken prisoner and was led before the sultan, to whom
he openly preached the Gospel. The sultan sent him back to
the Christian camp, and he passed on to the Holy Land. Here
he remained until September 1220. During his absence were
manifested the beginnings of the troubles in the order that were
to attain to such magnitude after his death. The circumstances
under which, at an extraordinary general chapter convoked
by him shortly after his return, he resigned the office of minister-general
(September 1220) are explained in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Franciscans</a></span>:
here, as illustrating the spirit of the man, it is in place to
cite the words in which his abdication was couched: &ldquo;Lord,
I give Thee back this family which Thou didst entrust to me.
Thou knowest, most sweet Jesus, that I have no more the power
and the qualities to continue to take care of it. I entrust it,
therefore, to the ministers. Let them be responsible before Thee
at the Day of Judgment, if any brother by their negligence, or
their bad example, or by a too severe punishment, shall go astray.&rdquo;
These words seem to contain the mere truth: Francis&rsquo;s peculiar
religious genius was probably not adapted for the government
of an enormous society spread over the world, as the Friars
Minor had now become.</p>

<p>The chief works of the next years were the revision and final
redaction of the Rule and the formation or organization of the
&ldquo;Third Order&rdquo; or &ldquo;Brothers and Sisters of Penance,&rdquo; a vast
confraternity of lay men and women who tried to carry out,
without withdrawing from the world, the fundamental principles
of Franciscan life (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tertiaries</a></span>).</p>

<p>If for no other reason than the prominent place they hold in
art, it would not be right to pass by the Stigmata without a
special mention. The story is well known; two years before
his death Francis went up Mount Alverno in the Apennines
with some of his disciples, and after forty days of fasting and
prayer and contemplation, on the morning of the 14th of
September 1224 (to use Sabatier&rsquo;s words), &ldquo;he had a vision:
in the warm rays of the rising sun he discerned suddenly a strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page939" id="page939"></a>939</span>
figure. A seraph with wings extended flew towards him from
the horizon and inundated him with pleasure unutterable.
At the centre of the vision appeared a cross, and the seraph was
nailed to it. When the vision disappeared Francis felt sharp
pains mingling with the delights of the first moment. Disturbed
to the centre of his being he anxiously sought the meaning of it
all, and then he saw on his body the Stigmata of the Crucified.&rdquo;
The early authorities represent the Stigmata not as bleeding
wounds, the holes as it were of the nails, but as fleshy excrescences
resembling in form and colour the nails, the head on the palm
of the hand, and on the back as it were a nail hammered down.
In the first edition of the <i>Vie</i>, Sabatier rejected the Stigmata;
but he changed his mind, and in the later editions he accepts their
objective reality as an historically established fact; in an
appendix he collects the evidence: there exists what is according
to all probability an autograph of Br. Leo, the saint&rsquo;s favourite
disciple and companion on Mount Alverno at the time, which
describes the circumstances of the stigmatization; Elias of
Cortona (<i>q.v.</i>), the acting superior, wrote on the day after his
death a circular letter wherein he uses language clearly implying
that he had himself seen the Stigmata, and there is a considerable
amount of contemporary authentic second hand evidence. On
the strength of this body of evidence Sabatier rejects all theories
of fraud or hallucination, whatever may be the explanation of
the phenomena.</p>

<p>Francis was so exhausted by the sojourn on Mount Alverno
that he had to be carried back to Assisi. The remaining months
of his life were passed in great bodily weakness and suffering,
and he became almost blind. However, he worked on with
his wonted cheerfulness and joyousness. At last, on the 3rd
of October 1226, he died in the Portiuncula at the age of forty-five.
Two years later he was canonized by Gregory IX., whom, as
Cardinal Hugolino of Ostia, he had chosen to be the protector
of his order.</p>

<p>The works of St Francis consist of the Rule (in two redactions),
the Testament, spiritual admonitions, canticles and a few
letters. They were first edited by Wadding in 1623. Two
critical editions were published in 1904, one by the Franciscans
of Quaracchi near Florence, the other (in a longer and a shorter
form) by Professor H. Boehmer of Bonn. Sabatier and Goetz
(see below) have investigated the authenticity of the several
works; and the four lists, while exhibiting slight variations,
are in substantial accord. Besides the works, properly so called,
there is a considerable amount of traditional matter&mdash;anecdotes,
sayings, sermons&mdash;preserved in the biographies and in the
<i>Fioretti</i>;<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> a great deal of this matter is no doubt substantially
authentic, but it is not possible to subject it to any critical
sifting.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Note on Sources.</i>&mdash;The sources for the life of St Francis and early
Franciscan history are very numerous, and an immense literature
has grown up around them. Any attempt to indicate even a selection
of this literature would here be impossible and also futile;
for the discovery of new documents has by no means ceased, and the
criticism of the materials is still in full progress, nor can it be said
that final results have yet emerged from the discussion. Students
will find the chief materials in the following collections: <i>Archiv für
Litteratur und Kirchengeschichte des Mittelalters</i> (ed. by Ehrle and
Denifle, 1885, &amp;c.); publications of the Franciscans of Quaracchi
(list to be obtained from Herder, Freiburg im Breisgau); and the
two series edited by Paul Sabatier, <i>Collection d&rsquo;études et de documents
sur l&rsquo;histoire religieuse et littéraire du moyen âge</i> (5 vols. published up
to 1906) and <i>Opuscules de critique historique</i> (12 fascicules): the
easiest and most consecutive way of following the controversy is
by the aid of the &ldquo;Bulletin Hagiographique&rdquo; in <i>Analecta Bollandiana</i>.
Relatively popular accounts of the most important sources
are supplied in the introductory chapters of Sabatier&rsquo;s <i>Vie de S.
François</i> and <i>Speculum perfectionis</i>, and Lempp&rsquo;s <i>Frère Élie de
Cortone</i>.</p>

<p>Concerning the life of St Francis and the beginnings of the order,
the chief documents that come under discussion are: the two <i>Lives</i>
by Thomas of Celano (1228 and 1248 respectively; Eng. trans.
with introduction by A.G. Ferrers Howell, 1908), of which the only
critical edition is that of Friar Ed. d&rsquo;Alençon (1906); the so-called
<i>Legenda trium sociorum</i>; the <i>Speculum perfectionis</i>, discovered by
Paul Sabatier and edited in 1898 (Eng. trans. by Sebastian Evans,
<i>Mirror of Perfection</i>, 1899). Sabatier&rsquo;s theory as to the nature of
these documents was, in brief, that the <i>Speculum perfectionis</i> was
the first of all the Lives of the saint, written in 1227 by Br. Leo, his
favourite and most intimate disciple, and that the <i>Legenda 3 Soc.</i>
is what it claims to be&mdash;the handiwork of Leo and the two other
most intimate companions of Francis, compiled in 1246; these are
the most authentic and the only true accounts, Thomas of Celano&rsquo;s
Lives being written precisely in opposition to them, in the interests
of the majority of the order that favoured mitigations of the Rule
especially in regard to poverty. For ten years the domain of
Franciscan origins was explored and discussed by a number of
scholars; and then the whole ground was reviewed by Professor W.
Goetz of Munich in a study entitled <i>Die Quellen zur Geschichte des
hl. Franz von Assisi</i> (1904). His conclusions are substantially the
same as those of Père van Ortroy, the Bollandist, and Friar Lemmens,
an Observant Franciscan, and are the direct contrary of Sabatier&rsquo;s:
the <i>Legenda 3 Soc.</i> is a forgery; the <i>Speculum perfectionis</i> is a compilation
made in the 14th century, also in large measure a forgery,
but containing an element (not to be precisely determined) derived
from Br. Leo; on the other hand, Thomas of Celano&rsquo;s two Lives
are free from the &ldquo;tendencies&rdquo; ascribed to them by Sabatier, and
that of 1248 was written with the collaboration of Leo and the other
companions; thus the best sources of information are those portions
of the <i>Speculum</i> that can with certainty be carried back to Br. Leo,
and the Lives by Thomas of Celano, especially the second <i>Life</i>.
Goetz&rsquo;s criticism of the documents is characterized by exceeding
carefulness and sobriety. Of course he does not suppose that his
conclusions are in all respects final; but his investigations show
that the time has not yet come when a biography of St Francis
could be produced answering to the demands of modern historical
criticism. The official life of St Francis is St Bonaventura&rsquo;s <i>Legenda</i>,
published in a convenient form by the Franciscans of Quaracchi
(1898); Goetz&rsquo;s estimate of it (<i>op. cit.</i>) is much more favourable
than Sabatier&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Paul Sabatier&rsquo;s fascinating and in many ways sympathetic <i>Vie de
S. François</i> (1894; 33rd ed., 1906; Eng. trans, by L.S. Houghton,
1901) will probably for a long time to come be accepted by the
ordinary reader as a substantially correct portrait of St Francis;
and yet Goetz declares that the most competent and independent
critics have without any exception pronounced that Sabatier has
depicted St Francis a great deal too much from the standpoint of
modern religiosity, and has exaggerated his attitude in face of the
church (<i>op. cit.</i> p. 5). In articles in the <i>Hist. Vierteljahrsschrift</i>
(1902, 1903) Goetz has shown that Sabatier&rsquo;s presentation of St
Francis&rsquo;s relations with the ecclesiastical authority in general, and
with Cardinal Hugolino (Gregory IX.) in particular, is largely based
on misconception; that the development of the order was not forced
on Francis against his will; and that the differences in the order
did not during Francis&rsquo;s lifetime attain to such a magnitude as to
cause him during his last years the suffering depicted by Sabatier.
This from a Protestant historian like Goetz is most valuable criticism.
In truth Sabatier&rsquo;s St Francis is an anachronism&mdash;a man at heart, a
modern pietistic French Protestant of the most liberal type, with a
veneer of 13th century Catholicism.</p>

<p>Of lives of St Francis in English may be mentioned those by Mrs
Oliphant (2nd ed., 1871) and by Canon Knox Little (1897). For
general information and references to the literature of the subject,
see Otto Zöckler, <i>Askese und Mönchtum</i> (1897), ii. 470-493, and his
article in Herzog&rsquo;s <i>Realencyklopädie</i> (ed. 3), &ldquo;Franz von Assisi&rdquo;
(1899); also Max Heimbucher, <i>Orden und Kongregationen</i> (1896), i.
§ 38. The chapter on St Francis in Emile Gebhart&rsquo;s <i>Italie mystique</i>
(ed. 3, 1899) is very remarkable; indeed, though this writer is as
little ecclesiastically-minded as Sabatier himself, his general picture
of the state of religion in Italy at the time is far truer; here also
Sabatier has given way to the usual temptation of biographers to
exalt their hero by depreciating everybody else.</p>

<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS OF MAYRONE<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Franciscus de Mayronis</span>] (d.
1325), scholastic philosopher, was born at Mayrone in Provence.
He entered the Franciscan order and subsequently went to
Paris, where he was a pupil of Duns Scotus. At the Sorbonne he
acquired a great reputation for ability in discussion, and was
known as the <i>Doctor Illuminatus</i> and <i>Magister Acutus</i>. He
became a professor of philosophy, and took part in the discussions
on the nature of Universals. Following Duns Scotus, he adopted
the Platonic theory of ideas, and denied that Aristotle had made
any contribution to metaphysical speculation. It is a curious
commentary on the theories of Duns Scotus that one pupil,
Francis, should have taken this course, while another pupil,
Occam, should have used his arguments in a diametrically
opposite direction and ended in extreme Nominalism.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS OF PAOLA<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Paula</span>), <b>ST,</b> founder of the Minims,
a religious order in the Catholic Church, was born of humble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page940" id="page940"></a>940</span>
parentage at Paola in Calabria in 1416, or according to the
Bollandists 1438. As a boy he entered a Franciscan friary,
but left it and went to live as a hermit in a cave on the seashore
near Paola. Soon disciples joined him, and with the bishop&rsquo;s
approval he built a church and monastery. At first they called
themselves &ldquo;Hermits of St Francis&rdquo;; but the object they
proposed to themselves was to go beyond even the strict Franciscans
in fasts and bodily austerities of all kinds, in poverty and
in humility; and therefore, as the Franciscans were the Minors
(<i>minores</i>, less), the new order took the name of Minims (<i>minimi</i>,
least). By 1474 a number of houses had been established in
southern Italy and Sicily, and the order was recognized and
approved by the pope. In 1482 Louis XI. of France, being on
his deathbed and hearing the reports of the holiness of Francis,
sent to ask him to come and attend him, and at the pope&rsquo;s
command he travelled to Paris. On this occasion Philip de
Comines in his <i>Memoirs</i> says: &ldquo;I never saw any man living so
holily, nor out of whose mouth the Holy Ghost did more manifestly
speak.&rdquo; He remained with Louis till his death, and Louis&rsquo;
successor, Charles VIII., held him in such high esteem that he
kept him in Paris, and enabled him to found various houses of
his order in France; in Spain and Germany, too, houses were
founded during Francis&rsquo;s lifetime. He never left France,
and died in 1507 in the monastery of his order at Plessis-les-Tours.</p>

<p>The Rule was so strict that the popes long hesitated to confirm
it in its entirety; not until 1506 was it finally sanctioned. The
most special feature is an additional vow to keep a perpetual
Lent of the strictest kind, not only flesh meat but fish and all
animal products&mdash;eggs, milk, butter, cheese, dripping&mdash;being
forbidden, so that the diet was confined to bread, vegetables,
fruit and oil, and water was the only drink. Thus in matter
of diet the Minims surpassed in austerity all orders in the West,
and probably all permanently organized orders in the East.
The strongly ascetical spirit of the Minims manifested itself in
the title borne by the superiors of the houses&mdash;not abbot (father),
or prior, or guardian, or minister, or rector, but corrector; and
the general superior is the corrector general. Notwithstanding
its extreme severity the order prospered. At the death of the
founder it had five provinces&mdash;Italy, France, Tours, Germany,
Spain. Later there were as many as 450 monasteries, and some
missions in India. There never was a Minim house in England
or Ireland. It ranks as one of the Mendicant orders. In 1909
there were some twenty monasteries, mostly in Sicily, but one
in Rome (S. Andrea delle Fratte), and one in Naples, in Marseilles
and in Cracow. There have been Minim nuns (only one convent
has survived, till recently at Marseilles) and Minim Tertiaries,
in imitation of the Franciscan Tertiaries. The habit of the
Minims is black.</p>

heiress. St Francis, the first child of this union, was born in
August 1567 when his mother was in her fifteenth year. M. de
Boisy was renowned for his experience and sound judgment,
and both parents were distinguished by piety, love of peace,
charity to the poor, qualities which early showed themselves in
their eldest son.</p>

<p>He received his education first at La Roche, in the Arve valley,
then at the college of Annecy, founded by Eustace Chappius,
ambassador in England of Charles V., in 1549. At the age of
thirteen or fourteen he went to the Jesuit College of Clermont
at Paris, where he stayed till the summer of 1588, and where he
laid the foundations of his profound knowledge, while perfecting
himself in the exercises of a young nobleman and practising a
life of exemplary virtue. At this time also he developed an
ardent love of France, a country which was politically in antagonism
with his own, though so closely linked to it geographically,
socially and by language. At the end of 1588 he went to Padua,
to take his degree in canon and civil law, a necessary prelude in
Savoy at that time to distinction in a civil career. His heart,
however, especially from the date of his receiving the tonsure
(1578), was already turned towards the Church, and he gave his
attention even more to theology, under the great masters
Antonio Possevino, S.J., and Gesualdo, afterwards general of
the Friars Minor, than to his legal course. &ldquo;At Padua,&rdquo; he said
to a friend, &ldquo;I studied law to please my father, and theology to
please myself.&rdquo; In that licentious university Francis found
the greatest difficulty in resisting attacks on his virtue, and once
at least had to draw his sword to defend his personal safety
against a band of ruffians. The gentleness for which he was
already renowned was not that of a weak, but of a strong
character. He returned to Savoy in 1592, and, while seeking
the occasion to overcome his father&rsquo;s resistance to his resolution
of embracing the ecclesiastical profession, took the diploma
of advocate to the senate. Meantime, without his knowledge,
his friends procured for him the post of provost of the chapter of
Geneva, an honour which reconciled M. de Boisy to the sacrifice
of more ambitious hopes. After a year of zealous work as preacher
and director he was sent by the bishop, Claude de Granier, to
try and win back the province of Chablais, which had embraced
Calvinism when usurped by Bern in 1535, and had retained it
even after its restitution to Savoy in 1564. At first the people
refused to listen to him, for he was represented to them as an
instrument of Satan, and all who had dealings with him were
threatened with the vengeance of the consistory. He therefore
wrote out his message on sheets which were passed from hand to
hand, and these, with the spectacle of his virtues and disinterestedness,
soon produced a strong effect. The sheets just spoken of
still exist in the Chigi library at Rome, and were published,
though with many alterations, in 1672, under the title of
<i>Les Controverses</i>. This must be considered the first work of
St Francis.</p>

<p>The re-erection of a wayside cross in Annemasse, at the gates of
Geneva, amid an enormous concourse of converts, an event
which closed the three years of his apostolate, led to the composition
of the <i>Défense ... de la Croix</i>, published in 1600.
An illness brought on by toil and privation forced him to leave
his work to others for nearly a year, but in August 1598 he returned
to his field of labour, and in October of that year practically
the whole country was Catholic again. Up to that time
preaching and conference had been the only weapons employed.
The stories of the use of soldiers to produce simulated conversions
are incorrect.<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Possibly the lamentable events of the
campaigns of 1589 in Gex and Chablais have been applied to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page941" id="page941"></a>941</span>
period 1594-1598. In October of this last year, however, the
duke of Savoy, who came then to assist in person at the great
religious feasts which celebrated the return of the country to
unity of faith, expatriated such of the leading men as obstinately
refused even to listen to the Catholic arguments. He also forbade
Calvinist ministers to reside in the Chablais, and substituted
Catholic for Huguenot officials. St Francis concurred in these
measures, and, three years later, even requested that those who,
as he said, &ldquo;follow their heresy, rather as a party than a religion,&rdquo;
should be ordered either to conform or to leave their country,
with leave to sell their goods. His conduct, judged not by a
modern standard, but by the ideas of his age, will be found
compatible with the highest Christian charity, as that of the duke
with sound political prudence. At this time he was nominated
to the pope as coadjutor of Geneva,<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and after a visit to Rome
he assisted Bishop de Granier in the administration of the newly
converted countries and of the diocese at large.</p>

<p>In 1602 he made his second visit to the French capital, when
his transcendent qualities brought him into the closest relations
with the court of Henry IV., and made him the spiritual father
of that circle of select souls who centred round Madame Acarie.
Among the celebrated personages who became his life friends from
this time were Pierre de Bérulle, founder of the French Oratorians,
Guillaume Duval, the scholar, and the duc de Bellegarde, the
latter a special favourite of the king, who begged to be allowed
to share the Saint&rsquo;s friendship. At this time also his gift as a
preacher became fully recognized, and de Sanzéa, afterwards
bishop of Bethlehem, records that Duval exhorted all his
students of the Sorbonne to listen to him and to imitate this,
&ldquo;the true and excellent method of preaching.&rdquo; His principles
are expressed in the admirable letter to André Frémyot of
October 1604.</p>

<p>De Granier died in September 1602, and the new bishop
entered on the administration of his vast diocese, which, as
a contemporary says, &ldquo;he found brick and left marble.&rdquo; His
first efforts were directed to securing a virtuous and well-instructed
clergy, with its consequence of a people worthy of
their pastors. All his time was spent in preaching, confessing,
visiting the sick, relieving the poor. His zeal was not confined
to his diocese. In concert with Jeanne Françoise Frémyot
(1572-1641), widow of the baron de Chantal, whose acquaintance
he made while preaching through Lent at Dijon in 1604, he
founded the order of the Visitation, in favour of &ldquo;strong souls
with weak bodies,&rdquo; as he said, deterred from entering the orders
already existing, by their inability to undertake severe corporal
austerities. The institution rapidly spread, counting twenty
houses before his death and eighty before that of St Jeanne.
The care of his diocese and of his new foundation were not
enough for his ardent charity, and in 1609 he published his
famous <i>Introduction to a Devout Life</i>, a work which was at once
translated into the chief European languages and of which
he himself published five editions. In 1616 appeared his <i>Treatise
on the Love of God</i>, which teaches that perfection of the spiritual
life to which the former work is meant to be the &ldquo;Introduction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The important Lents of 1617 and 1618 at Grenoble were a
prelude to a still more important apostolate in Paris, &ldquo;the theatre
of the world,&rdquo; as St Vincent de Paul calls it. This third visit
to the great city lasted from the autumn of 1618 to that of 1619;
the direct object of it was to assist in negotiating the marriage
of the prince of Piedmont with Chrétienne of France, but nearly
all his time was spent in preaching and works of mercy, spiritual
or corporal. He was regarded as a living saint. St Vincent
scarcely left him, and has given the most extraordinary testimonies
(as yet unpublished) of his heroic virtues. Mère Angélique
Arnaud, who at this time put herself under his direction and
wished to join the Order of the Visitation, attracted by its humility
and sweetness, may be named as the most interesting of his
innumerable penitents of this period. He returned to Savoy,
and after three years more of unwearying labour died at Lyons
on the 28th of December 1622. A universal outburst of veneration
followed; indeed his cult had already begun, and after
an episcopal inquiry the pontifical commission in view of his
beatification was instituted by decree of the 21st of July 1626,
a celerity unique in the annals of the Congregation of Rites.
The depositions of witnesses were returned to Rome in 1632,
but meantime the forms of the Roman chancery had been
changed by Urban VIII., and the advocates could not at once
continue their work. Eventually a new commission was issued
in 1656, and on its report, into which were inserted nineteen of
the former depositions, the &ldquo;servant of God&rdquo; was beatified in
1661. The canonization took place in 1665.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Besides the works which we have named, there were published
posthumously his <i>Entretiens</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a selection of the lectures given
to the Visitation, reported by the sisters who heard them, some of
his sermons, a large number of his letters, various short treatises of
devotion. The first edition of his united or so-called &ldquo;Complete&rdquo;
works was published at Toulouse in 1637. Others followed in 1641,
1647, 1652, 1663, 1669, 1685. The <i>Lettres</i> and <i>Opuscules</i> were republished
in 1768.</p>

<p>The only modern editions of the complete works which it is worth
while to name are those of Blaise (1821), Virès (1856-1858), Migne
(1861), and the critical edition published by the Visitation of Annecy,
of which the 14th volume appeared in 1905.</p>

<p>The biography of St Francis de Sales was written immediately
after his death by the celebrated P. de La Rivière and Dom John de
St François (Goulu), as well as by two other authors of less importance.
The saint&rsquo;s nephew and successor, Charles Auguste de Sales,
brought out a more extended life, Latin and French, in 1635. The
lives of Giarda (1650), Maupas du Tour (1657) and Cotolendi (1687)
add little to Charles Auguste. Marsollier&rsquo;s longer life, in two volumes
(1700), is quite untrustworthy; still more so that by Loyau d&rsquo;Amboise
(1833), which is rather a romance than a biography. The lives by
Hamon (1856) and Pérennès (1860), without adding much to preceding
biographies, are serious and edifying. A complete life, founded
on the lately discovered process of 1626 and the new letters, was being
prepared by the author of the present article at the time of his death.
With the Lives must be mentioned the <i>Esprit du B.F. de Sales</i> by
Camus, bishop of Belley, who, amid innumerable errors, gives
various interesting traits and sayings of his saintly friend. Among
the very numerous modern studies may be named an essay by Leigh
Hunt entitled &ldquo;The Gentleman Saint&rdquo; (<i>The Seer</i>, pt. ii. No. 41);
a remarkable <i>causerie</i> by Sainte-Beuve (<i>Lundis</i>, 3rd Jan. 1853);
<i>Le Réveil du sentiment religieux en France au XVII<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i>, by
Strowski (Paris, 1898); <i>Four Essays on S. F. de S.</i> and <i>Three Essays
on S. F. de S. as Preacher</i>, by Canon H.B. Mackey.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1d" id="ft1d" href="#fa1d"><span class="fn">1</span></a> This, at least, is the account given by Catholic authorities.
Less favourable is the view taken by non-Catholic historians, which
seems in some measure to be confirmed by St Francis himself.
According to this, Duke Charles Emmanuel of Savoy, who succeeded
his more tolerant father in 1580, was determined to reduce the
Chablais to the Catholic religion, by peaceful means if possible,
by force if necessary. After two years of preaching Francis wrote
to the duke (<i>&OElig;uvres compl.</i> ii. p. 551): &ldquo;During 27 months I have
scattered the seed of the Word of God in this miserable land; shall
I say among thorns or on stony ground? Certainly, save for the
conversion of the seigneur d&rsquo;Avully and the advocate Poncet, I
have little to boast of.&rdquo; In the winter of 1596-1597 Francis was
at Turin, and at his suggestion the duke decided on a regular plan
for the coercion of the refractory Protestants. This plan anticipated
that employed later by Louis XIV. against the Huguenots in France.
The Calvinist ministers were expelled; Protestant books were
confiscated and destroyed; the acts of Protestant lawyers and
officials were declared invalid. The country was flooded with
Jesuits and friars, whose arguments were reinforced by quartering
troops, veterans of the Indian wars in Mexico, on the refractory
inhabitants. Those whose stubborn persistence in error survived
all these inducements to repent were sent into exile. See the article

<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS, SIR PHILIP<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (1740-1818), English politician and
pamphleteer, the supposed author of the <i>Letters of Junius</i>,
and the chief antagonist of Warren Hastings, was born in Dublin
on the 22nd of October 1740. He was the only son of Dr Philip
Francis (c. 1708-1773), a man of some literary celebrity in his
time, known by his translations of Horace, Aeschines and
Demosthenes. He received the rudiments of an excellent
education at a free school in Dublin, and afterwards spent a
year or two (1751-1752) under his father&rsquo;s roof at Skeyton
rectory, Norfolk, and elsewhere, and for a short time he had
Gibbon as a fellow-pupil. In March 1753 he entered St Paul&rsquo;s
school, London, where he remained for three years and a half,
becoming a proficient classical scholar. In 1756, immediately
on his leaving school, he was appointed to a junior clerkship in
the secretary of state&rsquo;s office by Henry Fox (afterwards Lord
Holland), with whose family Dr Francis was at that time on
intimate terms; and this post he retained under the succeeding
administration. In 1758 he was employed as secretary to
General Bligh in the expedition against Cherbourg; and in the
same capacity he accompanied the earl of Kinnoul on his special
embassy to the court of Portugal in 1760.</p>

<p>In 1761 he became personally known to Pitt, who, recognizing
his ability and discretion, once and again made use of his services
as private amanuensis. In 1762 he was appointed to a principal
clerkship in the war office, where he formed an intimate friendship
with Christopher D&rsquo;Oyly, the secretary of state&rsquo;s deputy, whose
dismissal from office in 1772 was hotly resented by &ldquo;Junius&rdquo;;
and in the same year he married Miss Macrabie, the daughter
of a retired London merchant. His official duties brought him
into direct relations with many who were well versed in the
politics of the time. In 1763 the great constitutional questions
arising out of the arrest of Wilkes began to be sharply canvassed.
It was natural that Francis, who from a very early age had
been in the habit of writing occasionally to the newspapers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page942" id="page942"></a>942</span>
should be eager to take an active part in the discussion, though
his position as a government official made it necessary that his
intervention should be carefully disguised. He is known to have
written to the <i>Public Ledger</i> and <i>Public Advertiser</i>, as an advocate
of the popular cause, on many occasions about and after the
year 1763; he frequently attended debates in both Houses of
Parliament, especially when American questions were being
discussed; and between 1769 and 1771 he is also known to have
been favourable to the scheme for the overthrow of the Grafton
government and afterwards of that of Lord North, and for
persuading or forcing Lord Chatham into power. In January
1769 the first of the <i>Letters of Junius</i> appeared, and the series
was continued till January 21, 1772. They had been preceded
by others under various signatures such as, &ldquo;Candor,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Father of Candor,&rdquo; &ldquo;Anti-Sejanus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lucius,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nemesis,&rdquo;
which have all been attributed, some of them certainly in
error, to one and the same hand. The authorship of the <i>Letters
of Junius</i> has been assigned to Francis on a variety of grounds
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Junius</a></span>).</p>

<p>In March 1772 Francis finally left the war office, and in July
of the same year he left England for a tour through France,
Germany and Italy, which lasted until the following December.
On his return he was contemplating emigration to New England,
when in June 1773 Lord North, on the recommendation of Lord
Barrington, appointed him a member of the newly constituted
supreme council of Bengal at a salary of £10,000 per annum.
Along with his colleagues Monson and Clavering he reached
Calcutta in October 1774, and a long struggle with Warren
Hastings, the governor-general, immediately began. These
three, actuated probably by petty personal motives, combined
to form a majority of the council in harassing opposition to the
governor-general&rsquo;s policy; and they even accused him of
corruption, mainly on the evidence of Nuncomar. The death of
Monson in 1776, and of Clavering in the following year, made
Hastings again supreme in the council. But a dispute with
Francis, more than usually embittered, led in August 1780
to a minute being delivered to the council board by Hastings,
in which he stated that &ldquo;he judged of the public conduct of
Mr Francis by his experience of his private, which he had found
to be void of truth and honour.&rdquo; A duel was the consequence,
in which Francis received a dangerous wound (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hastings,
Warren</a></span>). Though his recovery was rapid and complete, he
did not choose to prolong his stay abroad. He arrived in England
in October 1781, and was received with little favour.</p>

<p>Little is known of the nature of his occupations during the
next two years, except that he was untiring in his efforts to procure
first the recall, and afterwards the impeachment of his
hitherto triumphant adversary. In 1783 Fox produced his India
Bill, which led to the overthrow of the coalition government. In
1784 Francis was returned by the borough of Yarmouth, Isle
of Wight; and although he took an opportunity to disclaim
every feeling of personal animosity towards Hastings, this did
not prevent him, on the return of the latter in 1785, from doing
all in his power to bring forward and support the charges which
ultimately led to the impeachment resolutions of 1787. Although
excluded by a majority of the House from the list of the managers
of that impeachment, Francis was none the less its most energetic
promoter, supplying his friends Burke and Sheridan with all the
materials for their eloquent orations and burning invectives.
At the general election of 1790 he was returned member for
Bletchingley. He sympathized warmly and actively with the
French revolutionary doctrines, expostulating with Burke on
his vehement denunciation of the same. In 1793 he supported
Grey&rsquo;s motion for a return to the old constitutional system of
representation, and so earned the title to be regarded as one
of the earliest promoters of the cause of parliamentary reform;
and he was one of the founders of the &ldquo;Society of the Friends
of the People.&rdquo; The acquittal of Hastings in April 1795 disappointed
Francis of the governor-generalship, and in 1798
he had to submit to the additional mortification of a defeat in
the general election. He was once more successful, however,
in 1802, when he sat for Appleby, and it seemed as if the great
ambitions of his life were about to be realized when the Whig
party came into power in 1806. His disappointment was great
when the governor-generalship was, owing to party exigencies,
conferred on Sir Gilbert Elliot (Lord Minto); he declined, it is
said, soon afterwards the government of the Cape, but accepted
a K.C.B. Though re-elected for Appleby in 1806, he failed
to secure a seat in the following year; and the remainder of his
life was spent in comparative privacy.</p>

<p>Among the later productions of his pen were, besides the
<i>Plan of a Reform in the Election of the House of Commons</i>, pamphlets
entitled <i>Proceedings in the House of Commons on the Slave
Trade</i> (1796), <i>Reflections on the Abundance of Paper in Circulation
and the Scarcity of Specie</i> (1810), <i>Historical Questions Exhibited</i>
(1818), and a <i>Letter to Earl Grey on the Policy of Great Britain
and the Allies towards Norway</i> (1814). His first wife, by whom
he had six children, died in 1806, and in 1814 he married his
second wife, Emma Watkins, who long survived him, and who
left voluminous manuscripts relating to his biography. Francis
died on the 23rd of December 1818. In his domestic relations
he was exemplary, and he lived on terms of mutual affection with
a wide circle of friends. He was, however, full of vindictiveness,
dissimulation and treachery, and there can be little doubt that
in his historic conflict with Warren Hastings unworthy personal
motives played a leading part.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">FRANCIS JOSEPH I.<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> (1830-&emsp;&emsp;), emperor of Austria, king
of Bohemia, and apostolic king of Hungary, was the eldest son
of the archduke Francis Charles, second son of the reigning
emperor Francis I., being born on the 18th of August 1830. His
mother, the archduchess Sophia, was daughter of Maximilian I.,
king of Bavaria. She was a woman of great ability and strong
character, and during the years which followed the death of the
emperor Francis was probably the most influential personage
at the Austrian court; for the emperor Ferdinand, who succeeded
in 1835, was physically and mentally incapable of performing
the duties of his office; as he was childless, Francis Joseph was
in the direct line of succession. During the disturbances of 1848,
Francis Joseph spent some time in Italy, where, under Radetzky,
at the battle of St Lucia, he had his first experience of warfare.
At the end of that year, after the rising of Vienna and capture of
the city by Windischgrätz, it was clearly desirable that there
should be a more vigorous ruler at the head of the empire, and
Ferdinand, now that the young archduke was of age, was able
to carry out the abdication which he and his wife had long desired.
All the preparations were made with the utmost secrecy; on the
2nd of December 1848, in the archiepiscopal palace at Olmütz,
whither the court had fled from Vienna, the emperor abdicated.
His brother resigned his rights of succession to his son, and
Francis Joseph was proclaimed emperor. Ferdinand retired
to Prague, where he died in 1875.</p>

<p>The history of the Dual Monarchy during his reign is told under
the heading of <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Austria-Hungary</a></span>, and here it is only necessary
to deal with its personal aspects. The young emperor was during
the first years of his reign completely in the hands of Prince Felix
Schwarzenberg, to whom, with Windischgrätz and Radetzky,
he owed it that Austria had emerged from the revolution
apparently stronger than it had been before. The first task was
to reduce Hungary to obedience, for the Magyars refused to
acknowledge the validity of the abdication in so far as it concerned
Hungary, on the ground that such an act would only be
valid with the consent of the Hungarian parliament. A further
motive for their attitude was that Francis Joseph, unlike his
predecessor, had not taken the oath to observe the Hungarian
constitution, which it was the avowed object of Schwarzenberg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page943" id="page943"></a>943</span>
to overthrow. In the war which followed the emperor himself
took part, but it was not brought to a successful conclusion till
the help of the Russians had been called in. Hungary, deprived
of her ancient constitution, became an integral part of the Austrian
empire. The new reign began, therefore, under sinister omens,
with the suppression of liberty in Italy, Hungary and Germany.
In 1853 a Hungarian named Lebenyi attempted to assassinate
the emperor, and succeeded in inflicting a serious wound with a
knife. With the death of Schwarzenberg in 1852 the personal
government of the emperor really began, and with it that long
series of experiments of which Austria has been the subject.
Generally it may be said that throughout his long reign Francis
Joseph remained the real ruler of his dominions; he not only
kept in his hands the appointment and dismissal of his ministers,
but himself directed their policy, and owing to the great knowledge
of affairs, the unremitting diligence and clearness of
apprehension, to which all who transacted business with him
have borne testimony, he was able to keep a very real control even
of the details of government.</p>

<p>The recognition of the separate status of Hungary, and the
restoration of the Magyar constitution in 1866, necessarily made
some change in his position, and so far as concerns Hungary
he fully accepted the doctrine that ministers are responsible
to parliament. In the other half of the monarchy (the so-called
Cisleithan) this was not possible, and the authority and influence
of the emperor were even increased by the contrast with the
weaknesses and failures of the parliamentary system. The most
noticeable features in his reign were the repeated and sudden
changes of policy, which, while they arose from the extreme
difficulty of finding any system by which the Habsburg monarchy
could be governed, were due also to the personal idiosyncrasies
of the emperor. First we have the attempt at the autocratic
centralization of the whole monarchy under Bach; the personal
influence of the emperor is seen in the conclusion of the Concordat
with Rome, by which in 1855 the work of Joseph II. was undone
and the power of the papacy for a while restored. The foreign
policy of this period brought about the complete isolation of
Austria, and the &ldquo;ingratitude&rdquo; towards Russia, as shown
during the period of the Crimean War, which has become
proverbial, caused a permanent estrangement between the two
great Eastern empires and the imperial families. The system
led inevitably to bankruptcy and ruin; the war of 1859, by
bringing it to an end, saved the monarchy. After the first
defeat Francis Joseph hastened to Italy; he commanded in
person at Solferino, and by a meeting with Napoleon arranged
the terms of the peace of Villafranca. The next six years, both
in home and foreign policy, were marked by great vacillation.
In order to meet the universal discontent and the financial
difficulties constitutional government was introduced; a parliament
was established in which all races of the empire were
represented, and in place of centralized despotism was established
Liberal centralization under Schmerling and the German Liberals.
But the Magyars refused to send representatives to the central
parliament; the Slavs, resenting the Germanizing policy of the
government, withdrew; and the emperor had really withdrawn
his confidence from Schmerling long before the constitution
was suspended in 1865 as a first step to a reconciliation with
Hungary. In the complicated German affairs the emperor in
vain sought for a minister on whose knowledge and advice he
could depend. He was guided in turn by the inconsistent advice
of Schmerling, Rechberg, Mensdorff, not to mention more
obscure counsellors, and it is not surprising that Austria was
repeatedly outmatched and outwitted by Prussia. In 1863,
at the <i>Fürstentag</i> in Frankfort, the emperor made an attempt
by his personal influence to solve the German question. He
invited all the German sovereigns to meet him in conference,
and laid before them a plan for the reconstruction of the confederation.
The momentary effect was immense; for some
of the halo of the Holy Empire still clung round the head of
the house of Habsburg, and Francis Joseph was welcomed to
the ancient free city with enthusiasm. In spite of this, however,
and of the skill with which he presided over the debates, the
conference came to nothing owing to the refusal of the king of
Prussia to attend.</p>

<p>The German question was settled definitively by the battle
of Königgrätz in 1866; and the emperor Francis Joseph, with
characteristic Habsburg opportunism, was quick to accommodate
himself to the new circumstances. Above all, he recognized
the necessity for reconciling the Magyars to the monarchy; for
it was their discontent that had mainly contributed to the
collapse of the Austrian power. He had already, in 1859, as the
result of a visit to Budapest, made certain modifications in the
Bach system by way of concession to Magyar sentiment, and in
1861 he had had an interview with Deák, during which, though
unconvinced by that statesman&rsquo;s arguments, he had at least
assured himself of his loyalty. He now made Beust, Bismarck&rsquo;s
Saxon antagonist, the head of his government, as the result
of whose negotiations with Deák the Austro-Hungarian Compromise
of 1867 was agreed upon. A law was passed by the
Hungarian diet regularizing the abdication of Ferdinand; at
the beginning of June Francis Joseph signed the inaugural
diploma and took the oath in Magyar to observe the constitution;
on the 8th he was solemnly crowned king of Hungary. The
traditional coronation gift of 100,000 florins he assigned to the
widows and orphans of those who had fallen in the war against
Austria in 1849.</p>

<p>Once having accepted the principle of constitutional government,
the emperor-king adhered to it loyally, in spite of the
discouragement caused by party struggles embittered by racial
antagonisms. If in the Cisleithan half of the monarchy parliamentary
government broke down, this was through no fault
of the emperor, who worked hard to find a <i>modus vivendi</i> between
the factions, and did not shrink from introducing manhood
suffrage in the attempt to establish a stable parliamentary
system. This expedient, indeed, probably also conveyed a
veiled threat to the Magyar chauvinists, who, discontented with
the restrictions placed upon Hungarian independence under the
Compromise, were agitating for the complete separation of
Austria and Hungary under a personal union only; for universal
suffrage in Hungary would mean the subordination of the Magyar
minority to the hitherto subject races. For nearly forty years
after the acceptance of the Compromise the attitude of the
emperor-king towards the Magyar constitution had been scrupulously
correct. The agitation for the completely separate
organization of the Hungarian army, and for the substitution
of Magyar for German in words of command in Hungarian
regiments, broke down the patience of the emperor, tenacious
of his prerogative as supreme &ldquo;war lord&rdquo; of the common army.
A Hungarian deputation which came to Vienna in September
1905 to urge the Magyar claims was received ungraciously by
the emperor, who did not offer his hand to the members, addressed
them in German, and referred them brusquely to the chancellor,
Count Goluchowski. This incident caused a considerable sensation,
and was the prelude to a long crisis in Hungarian affairs,
during which the emperor-king, while quick to repair the unfortunate
impression produced by his momentary pique, held
inflexibly to his resolve in the matter of the common army.</p>

<p>In his relations with the Slavs the emperor displayed the
same conciliatory disposition as in the case of the Magyars;
but though he more than once held out hopes that he would be
crowned at Prague as king of Bohemia, the project was always
abandoned. In this, indeed, as in other cases, it may be said
that the emperor was guided less by any abstract principles
than by a common-sense appreciation of the needs and possibilities
of the moment. Whatever his natural prejudices or
natural resentments, he never allowed these to influence his
policy. The German empire and the Italian kingdom had been
built up out of the ruins of immemorial Habsburg ambitions;
yet he refused to be drawn into an alliance with France in 1869
and 1870, and became the mainstay of the Triple Alliance of
Austria-Hungary, Germany and Italy. His reputation as a
consistent moderating influence in European policy and one of
the chief guarantors of European peace was indeed rudely
shaken in October 1908, the year in which he celebrated his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page944" id="page944"></a>944</span>
sixty years&rsquo; jubilee as emperor, by the issue of the imperial
recript annexing Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Habsburg dominions, in
violation of the terms of the treaty of Berlin. But his opportunism was
again justified by the result. Europe lost an ideal; but Austria gained
two provinces.</p>

<p>In his private life the emperor was the victim of terrible
catastrophes&mdash;his wife, his brother and his only son having
been destroyed by sudden and violent deaths. He married in
1854 Elizabeth, daughter of Maximilian Joseph, duke of
Bavaria, who belonged to the younger and non-royal branch
of the house of Wittelsbach. The empress, who shared the
remarkable beauty common to all her family, took little part
in the public life of Austria. After the first years of
married life she was seldom seen in Vienna, and spent much
of her time in travelling. She built a castle of great
beauty and magnificence, called the Achilleion, in the
island of Corfu, where she often o resided. In 1867 she
accompanied the emperor to Budapest, and took much interest
in the reconciliation with the Magyars. She became a
good Hungarian scholar, and spent much time in Hungary. An admirable
horsewoman, in later years she repeatedly visited England and Irland
for the hunting season. In 1897 she was assassinated at Geneva by an
Italian anarchist; previous attempts had been made on her and on her husband
during a visit to Trieste.</p>

<p>There was one son of the marriage, the crown prince
Rudolph (1857-1889). A man of much ability and promise, he
was a good linguist, and showed great interest in natural
history. He published two works, <i>Fifteen Days on the
Danube</i> and <i>A Journey in the East</i>, and also
promoted illustrated work giving a full description of the
whole Austro-Hungarian monarchy; he personally shared the
labours of the editorial work. In 1881 he merried Stéphanie,
daughter of the king of the Belgians. On 30th January 1889
he commited suicide at Mayerling, a country house near Vienna.
He left one daughter, Elizabeth, who was betrothed to Count
Alfred Windischgrätz in 1901. In 1900 his widow, the crown
princess Stéphanie, married Count Lonyay; by this she
sacrificed her rank and position within the Austrian
monarchy. Besides the crown prince the empress gave birth
to three daughters, of whom two survive: Gisela (born
1857), who married a son of the prince regent of Bavaria;
and Marie Valerie (born 1868), who married the archduke
Franz Salvator of Tuscany.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
